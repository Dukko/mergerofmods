A small group of ancestors to the modern Zegalax ended this relationship when they perpetrated the Treason of Sovon. This cabal detected and mind-controlled several teams of alien observers, who were as yet unaware of the psionic potential of their Zegalan subjects. Over more than forty years, their thralls were carefully manipulated and infiltrated into key positions, while advanced alien technology was clandestinely secreted to the Zegalans by way of psionic coercion. When the fateful betrayal at last came, their alien guardians were left in ruins and the Tribunal arose to light a new flame amongst the stars."
