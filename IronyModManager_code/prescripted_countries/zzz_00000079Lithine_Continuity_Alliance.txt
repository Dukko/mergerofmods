That is, a way of life wherein most members of society must tightly pack into hyperurbanized centers choked by pollution and endure the terrorizing whims of a cannibalistic death cult. Their religion teaches that this suffering is necessary to reach paradise, and nothing must stand between the Lithini and paradise."
