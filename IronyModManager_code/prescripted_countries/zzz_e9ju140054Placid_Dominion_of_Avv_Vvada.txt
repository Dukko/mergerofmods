The Tafrim place great faith in the power of technology to overcome the challenges in front of them. Facing a population crisis in their late Modern Age, the ruling family invested heavily in spaceflight, opening the planets and stars for exploration and expansion by their ever-wandering and ever-multiplying subjects."
