In their wake rose the Stigmergic Commonwealth, a boldly-conceived open source society driven by a gift economy and decentralized systems of collaborative organization. While the subsequent generations have encountered their share of problems with this form of government, the ideal has endured. As it looks to the stars, the Commonwealth remains remarkably free, tolerant, and peaceful."
