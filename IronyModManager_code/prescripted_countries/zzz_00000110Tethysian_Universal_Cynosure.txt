Concluding that the arrival of these colonists must indicate the beginning of a new cycle of galactic civilization, they then quickly reprioritized resources to interstellar expansion in order to locate and secure more diverse specimens..."

The Tethysian machines made short work of the colonist's attempt at self-defense and rapidly integrated the entire population as cyborgs in their ever-growing collective."
