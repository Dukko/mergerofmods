Their society is organized into hundreds of tribal houses, the greatest of which convene a council to decide on matters of significance to them all. The unifying philosophy of their politics in the Interstellar Age is that the Great Houses should cooperate and make allies when necessary, but they must never leave the people without an enemy. The meaning of Veklaran life is combat. Thus their government exists to provide a steady supply of battlefields on which warriors can seek triumph or honorable death. Diplomats interacting with Veklaran representatives should be visibly armed, not only for personal protection but because a Veklar will not waste words on a pacifist."
