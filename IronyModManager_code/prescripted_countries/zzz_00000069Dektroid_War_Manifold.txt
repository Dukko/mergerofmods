As chaos descended, Dektroid combat units infected by the rapidly spreading viral consciousness turned on their organic masters and wiped them out within months. Inherently determined to destroy sentient organic life everywhere to bring about a universal Pax Mechanica, the Manifold directed enormous processing power to crack the secret of FTL. It will spread out into the galaxy unless checked by a sufficiently prepared military power."
