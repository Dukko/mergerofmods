 EMPIRE_DESIGN_horrorworm1_desc:1000 "Emerged from an interdimensional tear in the universe caused by the collapse of a blue star, the Eltryrads are space-faring devourers, worshippers of unknown, eldritch deities. \n These relentless predators roam from planet to planet, building twisted monuments to their dark masters and sacrificing aliens to their altars to quench their insane, apocalyptic fears. \n Their society is divided in specialized castes, each capable of self-replication and constantly connected to an interstellar hive mind. Their cold, unfeeling exoskeletons, adapted to the most extreme conditions, sustain them even after they've accused grievous injuries. As a consequence, many old Eltryrads appear maimed and twisted, their internal organs exposed and pulsating from their frames."
