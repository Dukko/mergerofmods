 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_DEVOURING_SWARM:1000 "The Great Hunger drove us forwards, even before the Mind was capable of processing complex thoughts. We hunted, we fed, and we grew. As prey began to grow scarce, the ravenous yearning for flesh forced us to adapt.\n\nWe used tools and devised new strategies. As we feasted, the surface of [GetHomeWorldName] was nearly cleansed of biomass, but the Mind eventually came to a horrifying conclusion: [GetHomeWorldName] was finite. When we had consumed everything on this world, there would be nothing left to sustain us.\n\nForced to adapt once again, the Mind carefully nursed the remaining biomass while new tools were invented. The atom was eventually split and we developed space flight. With the discovery of FTL drives, the Mind howled with triumph. Other planets, and their biomass, were now finally within reach.\n\nThe hunt is on."
