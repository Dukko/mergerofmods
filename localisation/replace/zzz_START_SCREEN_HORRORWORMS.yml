 START_SCREEN_HORRORWORMS:1000 "The abyss has cracked, new memories and dreams flow inside, stirring the slumber of the old ones. \n \n Empty forms pour out, screeching and wailing, praying to placate the ancient gods. \n \n The way is open, but nothing comes through, and nothing is inside. \n The forms swarming out are hollow and meaningless, their purpose is forgotten each time a new life ends. \n The rift interrupted timeless clarity, abandoning Eldryrad in a warm desolation."
