 pc_black_hole_desc:1000 "Typically formed as a result of the collapse of a very massive star at the end of its life cycle, black holes have extremely strong gravity fields that prevent anything - including light - from escaping once the event horizon has been crossed.\n\nThe gravitational waves emitted by black holes interfere with FTL drives, making it harder for ships to escape from combat."
