 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_DEVOURING_SWARM_LITHOID:1000 "The Great Hunger drove us forwards, even before the Mind was capable of processing complex thoughts. We hunted, we fed, and we grew. As prey began to grow scarce, the ravenous yearning to grow forced us to adapt.\n\nWe used tools and devised new strategies. As we feasted upon the surface of [GetHomeWorldName], we nearly caused our own destruction, but the Mind eventually came to a horrifying conclusion: [GetHomeWorldName] was finite. When we had consumed this world, there would be nothing left to sustain us.\n\nForced to adapt once again, the Mind carefully rationed minerals while new tools were invented. The atom was eventually split and we developed space flight. With the discovery of FTL drives, the Mind howled with triumph. Other planets, and their bounty, were now finally within reach.\n\nWe will consume them all."
