 pc_neutron_star_desc:1000 "These incredibly dense stellar remnants are sometimes created when a massive star suffers a rapid collapse and explodes in a supernova. Although their diameter is typically as little as ten kilometers, their mass can be almost three times greater than an average G-type star.\n\nThe gravitational waves and radiation emitted by neutron stars must be carefully navigated around, slowing the sublight speed of ships."
