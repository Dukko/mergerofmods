 PC_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Nous pensons qu'il est nécessaire d'éclairer les cultures inférieures telles que la vôtre mais les sauvages [From.GetSpeciesAdj] sont si primitifs qu'il est difficile de dire si c'est possible pour votre espèce..."
 PC_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Les conditions de vie sordides que subit votre peuple sont quelquefois portées à notre connaissance, et nous nous demandons comment quiconque pourrait survivre dans un tel état de sauvagerie."
 PC_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Il est indéniable que vous autres barbares dussiez être éduqués à respecter l'étiquette. Vous rencontrer est toujours une pénible expérience."
 PC_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Regardez-moi ce pathétique, primitif [From.GetSpeciesName]. Un jour nous viendrons vous civiliser, aussi difficile que cela puisse paraître."
 PC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Il semblerait que votre peuple soit primitif. Peut-être accepteriez-vous d'en apprendre un peu plus au sujet de notre culture supérieure ?"
 PC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Il est difficile pour nous de comprendre vos coutumes primitives, mais nous nous y efforçons pour le bénéfice de la diplomatie."
 PC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Nous avons notre meilleur intérêt à l'esprit. Un jour, nous vous enseignerons les bons usages de la civilisation, bon gré mal gré. Tel est le fardeau des [Root.GetSpeciesAdj].
 PC_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Que peut-on attendre de tels sales petits sauvages comme vous ? Vous êtes des sauvages ! Des sauvages !"
 PC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Bien qu'ils descendent d'une culture primitive, et sous-développée, nous pensons que les [From.GetSpeciesName] peuvent être considérés comme de nobles sauvages."
 PC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Tenez bon chers amis ! Un jour, vous serez aussi civilisés que nous."
 PC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Il est des sauvages qui refusent d'admettre la supériorité de notre culture, et qui refusent de se civiliser. Nous somme heureux que vous ne soyez pas l'un d'entre eux."
 PC_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Sauvages ! Sauvages !  Savages! Savages! Sales petits démons puants ! A peine conscients !"
 PC_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Nous nous sommes efforcés autant que possible à former les [From.GetSpeciesName] et à les élever à un niveau acceptable de civilisation. Il semblerait que nous dussions désormais recourir à la force."
 PC_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Sauvages ! Sauvages ! Sauvages ! Faites résonner les tambours de guerre !"
 # Vassal greetings
 PC_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "Il est humiliant pour nous de servir des primitifs tels que vous. Mais attendez un peu. Vous verrez bientôt..."

 # Savage Raiders
 SR_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Les [From.GetSpeciesName] semblent... vulnérables. Montrez-vous prudents, ou bien nous pourrions... organiser des pillages dans votre voisinage..."
 SR_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Nous qui apprécions piller nos ennemis, sommes déçus de voir à quels points les pathétiques [From.GetSpeciesName] sont dénusés du moindre objet de valeur à leur prendre de force."
 SR_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Les [From.GetSpeciesName] sont devenus paresseurs et complaisants. Ce serait dommage si quelqu'un vous attaquait, pour piller toutes vos richesses..."
 SR_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Nous vous ménageons pour le moment. Mais tiens-toi prêt, pathétique [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]! Nous finirons pas venir piller votre territoire."

 SR_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Votre peuple est sage et fort. Il serait imprudent pour nous de provoquer une nation aussi puissante comme nous le faisons d'habitude. Peut-être auriez-vous un ennemi que nous pourrions piller ?"
 SR_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Nous considérons les [From.GetSpeciesName] comme un honorable adversaire de valeur. En conséquence, nous n'envahirons pas votre territoire à moins d'une absolue nécessité."
 SR_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Bien qu'il soit dans notre nature de piller et de ravager, nous savons reconnaître une grande nation comme les [From.GetSpeciesName] quand nous en voyons une, et nous promettons de ne pas chercher à vous offenser de quelque manière que ce soit."
 SR_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Peuh ! Retournons piller ! Retournons ravager ! Repartez avant que nous vous tuions tous !"
 SR_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Prend garde, [From.GetRulerName]! La plus grande joie pour un guerrier [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] est de vaincre ses ennemis, de les mettre à genoux, de prendre tout ce qu'ils possède, de le voir s'effondrer en larmes, et de lui prendre ses femmes et ses filles."
 SR_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Nous pillerons votre territoire au point que votre peuple subira la pauvreté et la famine jusqu'à la fin des temps !"

 DOTF_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Peut-être parviendrons-nous un jour à débarrasser cet univers des démons et des diables."

 DOTF_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "We are afraid that our masters in the [From.GetName] are falling to heresy. If you go down a path we cannot follow, the consequences may be dire..."
 DOTF_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_02:0 "Our inquisitors report that the taint of heresy abounds in the [From.GetName]. Could our masters be hiding such evil thoughts? We hope not, but we wouldn't be surprised."

 CH_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "Let's meditate on the infinite wisdom of the universe, friend."
 CH_FRIENDLY_GREETING_05:0 "The energy from [From.GetHomeWorldName]! We can just sense the inner peace."

 # Open-Minded Worshippers
 OMW_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Nos savants cherchent constamment à retirer quelque chose de bon des croyances des [From.GetSpeciesName], mais c'est à chaque fois un échec."
 OMW_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Bien que nous apprécions mener les négociations dans une atmosphère de tolérance et de compréhension mutuelle, il est difficile de procéder ainsi avec des individus tels que vous."
 OMW_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Nous craignons que les [From.GetSpeciesAdj] [From.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural] ne grandissent dans un environnement qui ne soit pas idéal pour leur développement spirituel personnel."
 OMW_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Bien que votre culture soit indéniablement sous-développée et barbare, nous croyons qu'il est tout de même important que nous restions ouverts d'esprit. Ce n'est pas votre faute si votre peuple est aussi... primitif."
 OMW_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Bien le boujour. Nous cherchons à mieux comprendre les croyances des autres peuples. De cette manière, nous pouvons mieux nous comprendre nous-mêmes."
 OMW_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Nous espérons que les dirigeants de la [From.GetName] sont prêts à engager un dialogue fructueux au sujet des différences et des similarités entre nos cultures et nos systèmes de pensée."

 OMW_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Ah ! Nos amis ! C'est toujours un plaisir que d'avoir des débats amicaux et profonds avec vous au sujet de la nature du cosmos."
 OMW_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Même si un [Root.GetSpeciesName] et un [From.GetSpeciesName] ne partagent pas le même point de vue sur certains sujets, nos points communs et notre compréhension mutuelle sont plus grandes que nos différences et que nos désaccords."
 OMW_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Se lancer dans un débat religieux avec vous est toujours un grand honneur. Bien que nous soyons en désaccord sur quelques problèmes clefs, nous croyons que les savants de la [From.GetName] n'ont qu'une perspective différent, mais que celle-ci n'est jamais fausse ou dévoyée."
 OMW_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Parfois, il nous faut combattre. C'est une chose triste, car votre culture et vos croyances ont leur propre beauté, mais vos dirigeants sont particulièrement désagréables."
 OMW_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Pourquoi nos deux peuples doivent-ils souffrir ainsi ! C'est pour cela que nous méprisons la guerre. Pourquoi ne pouvons-nous pas discuter de nos différences dans une atmosphère de paix et de mutuelle compréhension ? Mais il est parfois nécessaire de remonter ses manches et de faire la guerre."

 HV_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "A la fin, qu'est-ce qui sépare un [Root.GetSpeciesName] d'un [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]? L'argent ? Le pouvoir ? Non, un [Root.GetSpeciesName] choisit, et un [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult] obéit !"
 HV_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Quelle est la différence entre un [Root.GetSpeciesName] et un [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]? Un [Root.GetSpeciesName] cosntruit. Un [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult] demande 'Où est ma part ?'. Un [Root.GetSpeciesName] crée. Un [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult] dit, 'Que vont en penser les voisins ?' Un [Root.GetSpeciesName] invente.

 HV_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Bien que vous soyez puissant, [From.GetSpeciesName], vous êtes toujours des esclaves. Un [Root.GetSpeciesName] est libre, car il a la faculté de choisir. Un [From.GetSpeciesName] doit obéir."

 IM_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Si un soldat [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] s'envole pour les étoiles, il ne sera qu'un cadavre dans l'infini de l'espace. Mais s'il meurt pour la [Root.GetName], alors il ne regrettera rien. Nous ne vous craignons pas."
 IM_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Technologie [From.GetSpeciesAdj], âme [Root.GetSpeciesAdj]. Notre peuple croit que c'est la meilleure philosophie. Bien que nous n'étions pas civilisé, notre amitié nous a aidés à devenir plus forts et plus puissants, et tout cela grâce à vous."
 IM_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Ce serait un honneur que de combattre un aussi grand empire que la [Root.GetName], mais nous chérissons trop les liens étroits que nous entretenons avec vous."

 IM_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Quand nous envoyons nos soldats à la guerre, nous n'imaginons pas qu'ils reviendront vivants. Leur but est de tuer jusqu'au dernier d'entre vous, bâtards [From.GetSpeciesAdj] !"
 IM_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Notre guerre contre vous est justifiée, car la [From.GetName] est un régime impérialiste qui ne cherche qu'à oppresser les nations vulnérables de la galaxie."
 IM_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "En attaque comme en défense, nos vaisseaux sont des forteresses de métal qui défendront chaque once du territoire [Root.GetSpeciesAdj]. Nos vaisseaux de métal pur détruiront la [From.GetName] qui a déclaré la [Root.GetName] comme son ennemi."

 IM_GENERIC_GREETING_01:0 "It seems that the [From.GetName] has developed its spiritual institutions to be quite complex, as befits all truly advanced civilizations. Perhaps there is much we can learn in order to strengthen ourselves."
 IM_GENERIC_GREETING_02:0 "Your dedication to technological pursuits have clearly made you strong. Knowledge is no doubt the key to becoming an advanced civilization."
 IM_GENERIC_GREETING_03:0 "It is strange that dedication to peace can make one so strong, but the [From.GetName] is a testament to that. We have much to learn from your peace-loving ways."
 IM_GENERIC_GREETING_04:0 "Only the mightiest civilizations survive in this galaxy of ours. You [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are skilled in the arts of war, and our soldiers seek to learn your secrets, but we understand if you are hesitant. After all, what if one day we become the mighty ones?"
 IM_GENERIC_GREETING_05:0 "The [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are a wise people, trying to keep their nation as homogenous as possible and shunning foreign influences. We hope to be strong one day so we can emulate your practices, for we are currently too weak and must learn from outsiders."
 IM_GENERIC_GREETING_06:0 "Clearly, friendship and mutual understanding is the proper way if any country wishes to join the galactic community. We still have much to learn from your beliefs, and now seek to emulate your diplomatic techniques and philosophies."
 IM_GENERIC_GREETING_07:0 "There is only strength in this galaxy - strength and order. Since time immemorial, we have sought order, but knew not how to properly acquire and utilize it. By observing and learning from you, we see how a society can be orderly and become a true civilization."
 IM_GENERIC_GREETING_08:0 "The [From.GetName] is respected by many in the galaxy for its just society that provides freedom and happiness for all its citizens. This, it seems, has been your source of strength, and it is one we hope to become like one day."
 # Efficient Bureaucrats
 EB_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Nous vous remercions d'avoir contacté le des affaires étrangères. Nos représentants sont en cours de négociations avec des aliens plus civilisés que les barbares [From.GetSpeciesName]. A cet instant, le temps d'attente avant que l'un de nos représentant soit disponible est estimé à... deux centaines d'années standard au troisième bip. Nous vous prions de bien vouloir attendre. Si vous souhaitez réécouter ce message, tapez 4."
 EB_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Nous rpéférons éviter de nous lancer dans des négociations avec les pathétiques parasites de la [From.GetName]. D'après les dernières directives publiées par l'Agence Administrative des Directives, avec le concours du Ministère des Affaires Etrangères, la [From.GetName] n'est pas digne de confiance, et je comprends bien pourquoi."
 EB_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Pourquoi cette réunion ? Il doit y avoir une sorte d'erreur administrative. Les bureaucrates [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] senior m'ont indiqué que nous n'avions aucun intérêt pour les sauvages qui se nomment la [From.GetName]. Très bien, vous pouvez parler, mais je vais devoir remplir une plainte auprès du Département de la Plannification des Réunion."
 EB_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "I am sorry, but I will need to put you on hold. We have more important matters to attend to at the moment. I am extremely overworked and dealing with the [From.GetName] is not a high priority for us at the moment."
 EB_HOSTILE_GREETING_05:0 "Please sign forms P245, X9-11, and R9-42-5NX. No offense, but we have little trust in your government's institutions, so we need to make sure everything is in order before we can begin negotiations."
 EB_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "J'appelle maintenant le numéro... attendez, qui êtes-vous déjà ? Oh, vous êtes l'un de ces [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult] sous-développés de la [From.GetName]. Vous n'étiez pas prévu sur mon planning, vous deviez rencontrer un représentant de rang inférieur qui s'occupe des primitifs comme vous. Quelqu'un peut-ila appeler mon secrétaire ?"
 EB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Bienvenue dans la [Root.GetName]. Avant de commencer les négociations, veuillez renseigner ces documents. En particulier les documents AT6X-231, 32P9, TT4-01, 6GJKF-F, et CU11-7. Il y en a plusieurs autres à remplir, mais pour les obteniur vous devez aller voir la Commission de Sécurité Domestique. Oh, et puis, nous n'acceptons que l'encre noire."
 EB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Veuillez attendre un instant, je dois renseigner les documents BX-22-A and KSD-34 pour l'Agence d'Archives Diplomatiques avant de débuter ces négociations. Cela ne prendra que quelques minutes, je vous assure. Maintenant... où ai-je mis mon stylo... J'espère que je ne l'ai pas perdu, ou bien je devrai envoyer un rapport à l'AAD."
 EB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Il semble y avoir une erreur. Pourquoi avez-vous rempli le document AT6X-224? Vous deviez renseigner le document AT6X-231. Nous ne pouvons pas débuter les négociations avant que vous ne répondiez au document approprié. Mes excuses, il ne s'agit que du protocole administratif. Au moins, les vingt autres documents ont été remplis correctement. Tenez, vous pouvez emprunter mon stylo."
 EB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "Now serving number 1958374. Or I think that's your number. Thank you for waiting. Who are you and how may we help you?"
 EB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "I just need you to sign here, and here, and here. If you want to know, these are forms NYE-7, FU88-20, and ZZXO, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs needs to have these sent to the Policy and Planning Agency before we are allowed to continue."
 EB_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Le Bureau des Analyses et des Statistiques a déterminé que la [From.GetName] était plus puissante que la [Root.GetName]. Je dois écrire un rapport à l'Agence des Politiques Aliens afin de déterminer comment porcéder envers des aggresseurs aussi violents et bestiaux."
 EB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "J'ai malheureusement une contradiction sur mon planning, mais notre ami de la [From.GetName] est bien plus important que quelqu'autre tâche bureacratique. Après tout, nous passerions outre n'importe quel formulaire si cela nous permettait de poursuivre notre relation mutuellement bénéfique."
 EB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Nous vous remercions d'avoir contacté le Ministère des Affaires Etrangères de la [Root.GetName]. Nos représentants sont actuellement en négociation avec les aliens plus barbares que les civilisés [From.GetSpeciesName]. Cependant, étant d'une importance capitale pour nous, nous vous enverrons dès que possible un représentant. Si vous souhaitez réécouter ce message, tapez 8."
 EB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Nous envisageons de créer une sous-agence au sens du Ministère des Affaires Etrangères appelée le Bureau des Affaires [From.GetSpeciesAdj], afin de poursuivre la construction des relations avec la [From.GetName]. Malheureusement, cela demandera beaucoup de temps et de paperasse..."
 EB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "Don't worry, friend. I've already filled out all the forms for you (forms PX-22, GURG-8, YAPW, 5823-SAF, and 15-WRI as you can see here). I don't want to waste your valuable time."
 EB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_05:0 "I am so sorry you had to wait so long. We're understaffed and overworked here, unfortunately. But our partnership with the [From.GetName] is so important to us."
 EB_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Nous vous remercions d'avoir contacté le Ministère des Affaires Etrangères. Nous sommes actuellement en guerre avec vous et ne sommes pas disponibles pour des négociations. Si vous souhaitez réécouter ce message, tapez 4."
 EB_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Le Bureau de Logistique [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] est en train de remplir les documents nécessaires au développement d'armes nouvelles et plus efficaces pour les utiliser contre vous, misérable [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]. Avec un peu de chance, le Ministère de la Défense donnera son approbation !"
 EB_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Pourquoi sommes-nous ici ? Les protocoles de sécurité XTV-22 et G8-4DTJ devraient avoir fait en sorte que vous n'arriviez pas jusque là. Allez-vous-en ! Nous sommes en guerre, et je pers un temps précieux que j'aurais pu utiliser pour remplir d'importants documents bureaucratiques !"
 EB_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "Great. Now that you've come here I must file out forms 93-SFD, FIE-134-34N, and IAF-2 to the Ministry of Suspicious Foreign Contacts and the Xeno Policy Agency. That's just the protocol when we're at war.. Wait a moment, this won't take long."
 EB_WAR_GREETING_05:0 "Please sign these forms here. Don't worry, this is form XUD-4. You were thinking of XUD-1. XUD-1 is the one you need to sign to surrender to us, XUD-4 is merely the one you need to sign if you want to negotiate with us."

 GF_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "La volonté des citoyens [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] est claire : la [From.GetName] est une bande de salopards avides et de traîtres. Nous ne tolérerons aucune transgression de votre part."
 GF_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "La [Root.GetName] sera là pour l'éternité, à jamais. C'est notre destin. Vous, la [From.GetName], par contre, êtes pareils à de pathétiques [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]s rampants, qui finiront pas disaparaître des annales de l'Histoire."

Nous pouvons très bien accepter un bon voisinage, mais nous pouvons tout aussi bien combattre et nous défendre si nécessaire. Gardez cela à l'esprit."
 GF_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Soyez prévenus - nous ne nous laisserons pas être menacés par des agresseurs telles que la [From.GetName]. Bien sûr, vous êtes probablement plus forts que nous, mais la force n'est pas synonyme de victoire et de réussite."

 CN_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Bah. La [From.GetName] n'est ni un adversaire de valeur, ni une société cultivée dont nous pourrions tirer des enseignements. Vous n'êtes qu'un bon réservoir pour le pillage, ce que nous pourrions bien faire dans un avenir proche."
 CN_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Nos guerriers regardent à l'intérieur de vos frontières, et ils voient un état faible et décadent qui n'attend que d'être cueilli. Vos précieuses oeuvres d'art se vendront sans doute à un bon prix sur les marchés [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] markets, même si votre peuple est sans valeur."
 CN_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Nous sommes toujours prêts à adopter des idées venus d'autres cultures, mais nous trouvons que la société [From.GetSpeciesAdj] society a peu de choses à nous offrir, car elle est sans valeur, et n'est pleine que de vices et d'inutilités."

 ST_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Dégagez ! Nous ne vous vendrons aucun esclave. Ce serait leur faire trop de tord."
 ST_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Êtes-vous venus vous offrir en esclavage ? L'offre est tentante, mais nous refusons. Vous n'êtes pas des esclaves de valeur, et votre vente ne permettrait pas de réaliser des profits."

 ST_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Vous fairiez mieux de ne pas être l'un de ces ennuyants idéalistes qui viennent nous dire à quel point il est mal de faire du commerce d'esclaves. Ils ne comprennent tout simplement pas que la galaxie ne fonctionne pas comme ils se la représentent."
 ST_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Nous sommes plus que contents de travailler ensemble pour faire des profits. L'achat d'esclaves aujourd'hui pourrait se révéler être un investissement très rentable pour l'avenir de la [From.GetName]."
 ST_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Que voulez-vous ? Laissez-nous tranquilles. Nous savons que vous pourriez facilement détruire notre économie toute entière, mais nous constatons que vous nous épargnez pour le moment. Eh bien, allez-vous essayer de 'libérer' nos esclaves ? Comprenez que ça ne changera rien - il y aura toujours profusion de terres à conquérir, d'autres esclaves à libérer."
 ST_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Mon ami !  C'est un plaisir de vous voir ! Je dois vous faire un cadeau. Désireriez-vous un esclave ludique de haute qualité, compétent dans de nombreuses formes de divertissement ? Ou bien un esclave guerrier, pour vous défendre en permanence et bien plsu encore ? Si vous désirez quelque chose d'autre, je serai heureux de vous l'offrir : une spécialité [Root.GetSpeciesAdj], ou des marchandises de luxe..."

 SP_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Un [Root.GetSpeciesName] sage sait qu'il est préférable de rester silencieux. Palheureusement, un [From.GetSpeciesName] n'est pas sage, et au lieu de cela, il cherche à causer le trouble par son bavardage idiot."

 SP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Il y a toujours de nouvelles opportunités commerciales, et certains marchands [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] ont montré de l'intérêt pour le marché [From.GetSpeciesAdj]. Peut-être la [Root.GetName] et la [From.GetName] devraient-elles négocier un traité profitable aux deux parties. Un échange de biens, d'idées et de cultures, serait un geste encourageant."
 SP_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "La [From.GetName] est comme la rose avec ses épines. Dangereuse, et même léthale, mais les [Root.GetSpeciesName] ne peuvent ignorer sa beauté et son attrait. Nous espérons que vous tenez plus de la fleur que de l'épine."

 SP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Ah, vous savez, mon amis, les produits [From.GetSpeciesAdj] se vendent au plus haut prix dans nos bazars. Nombreux sont ceux qui dans la,[Root.GetName], semble-t-il, se délectent de ce que votre peuple produit."

 EIX_GENERIC_GREETING_18:0 "Some xenocide experts would consider you a problem. We consider you an opportunity to grow our business."
 EIX_GENERIC_GREETING_19:0 "We are a performance-based organization. If we are unable to xenocide a species quickly, efficiently, and innovatively, then we will do our best to review our work and see how we can improve ourselves."

How can we rain death and destruction on your planets today?"
 EIX_GENERIC_GREETING_29:0 "You may have heard rumors that we are outsourcing our labor to other species in the galaxy. Rest assured, valued customer. We are the galaxy's foremost experts in xenociding the rest - we never outsource our labor to other species who would be better off completely destroyed."

 # Depraved Breeders
 DB_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "How dare you look down on us. We enjoy the act of copulation. You do not, and for that the [From.GetName] is full of close-minded, bigoted prudes."
 DB_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Breed with you? What are we, perverts? That's too much, even for us, and that's saying something."
 DB_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "We like to think that every species has its own unique beauty that must be admired, but we find it hard to think of anything positive or beautiful about the hideous [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Engaging in intimate relations with the likes of you would be humiliating."
 DB_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "You are disgusting. So disgusting even the most desperate [Root.GetSpeciesName] wouldn't want to breed with you. Haven't we told you already that we've rejected your affections?"
 DB_HOSTILE_GREETING_05:0 "You all are such prudes. You can't enjoy pleasure for pleasure's sake, and repress your lust for no reason at all. We, on the other hand, are in constant euphoria, not because of some outdated morals, but because we are enlightened by our acceptance of our base desires."
 DB_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "You seem very innocent and naive. A little too innocent and naive. It is so tempting to corrupt such innocence..."
 DB_DOMINEERING_GREETING_02:0 "Haha! The [From.GetName] loves being in a position of meekness, a position of weakness. You love it when other nations dominate you. Don't you worry, we like playing rough but we'll be a little gentle with you."
 DB_DOMINEERING_GREETING_03:0 "Your weakness is due to your nation's prudish attitude towards life. By opening yourselves up in terms of your attitudes towards life, you also open yourselves up towards many new opportunities."
 DB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "We believe that intimacy is an important part of any relationship. Do you agree?"
 DB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "The [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are known throughout the galaxy for being the best lovers. We can show you our abilities, if you like..."
 DB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Hopefully you are aware, but we can be very satisfying partners, the best partners you'll ever have... if you cooperate with us."
 DB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "Yes, there are many little [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] [Root.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural] running around. We enjoy making [Root.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural]. Is that so hard to undersetand?"
 DB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "Intimate relations is much better than war when it comes to solving problems, don't you think? If only the rest of the galaxy believed more in the ideals of love to be shared among all..."
 DB_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "If you want to know, we don't mind things getting rough, just remember to be a little gentle with us, alright? Being weaker than others... well, a pleasant change of pace, in a way. Sometimes you have to switch roles if you want to continue to keep things exciting."
 DB_THREATENED_GREETING_02:0 "Your strength is a clear testament to your government having its priorities straight. It's clear that the [From.GetName] encourages your populace to procreate and spread the love. This is how all the great nations have stayed afloat in turbulent times."
 DB_THREATENED_GREETING_03:0 "[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] like playing rough, don't they? They like dominating other species and showing them their place, no? Such unbridled, aggressive, primal power."
 DB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "We always enjoy it when you come here. Perhaps we should continue in the bedroom?"
 DB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "We've heard that your skills in love rival our own... would you like to have a contest to compare our abilities?"
 DB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "You know what we always like seeing? When attractive diplomats from the [From.GetName] come. Come visit us, I mean."
 DB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "I don't mind letting my [Root.GetSpeciesMouthName] get to know your [From.GetSpeciesMouthName] a little better. If you catch my drift."
 DB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_05:0 "The [From.GetSpeciesMouthName] of the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] is so beautiful... and undoubtedly skilled, too, in the art of oral persuasion."
 DB_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "All's fair in love and war! We fight just as well as we love."
 DB_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Are you ready for us to unleash our fire on you? Be prepared!"
 DB_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "You couldn't even last one minute in a proper battle with us. Your stamina leaves much to be desired."
 DB_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "The [From.GetName] is pathetic. If your supposed military prowess is a reflection of your skills in lovemaking, then it is clear your species is in risk of extinction within a generation or two."
 DB_WAR_GREETING_05:0 "War is like love. You must be passionate, you must be willing to sacrifice all for a greater ideal. You must also be willing to hit them hard, to show them you care about it all."
 # Vassal greetings
 DB_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "Master! It is always pleasurable to see you. How may we service you today?"
 DB_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "We enjoy providing services to many in this galaxy, but to you, it is a great humiliation, and not the fun kind of humiliation either."
 # Declaration of War
 DB_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! We enjoy intimacy just as we enjoy war. If we can ensure a better future, where we can copulate in peace, than so be it."
 # Dwellers in the Ephemeral
 DIE_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Life is so short. Why waste your energy bullying others? The [From.GetName] is full of short-sighted, unwise leaders."
 DIE_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Why are the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] always so rushed? Why do you spend so much time worrying about power and glory? Such arrogance and ignorance! You must learn to calm yourself, see the brightness of the stars and the darkness of the night for what they are, and not as material resources to be exploited."
 DIE_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Ha! You think yourself so mighty with your fleets and your abundant cities and planets. Our lives are so short, friend, don't you know? Your efforts will all be in vain, for one day it will all be swallowed up by the eternal void of the universe."
 DIE_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Your lives are not only short, but worthless. How could you ever create anything of value?"
 DIE_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "We are but dust in the wind. Even the brightest of stars have to die, eventually. Keep that in mind."
 DIE_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Our lives are so short, and existence so impermanent. That only means that we must make the most of what we do today."
 DIE_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "We are but mere atoms in the universe when it comes to the grand scheme of things. But even so, we must make the most of what we have. Whether you are a foe or a friend, we do not know, but we sincerely hope it is the latter."
 DIE_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "[Root.GetSpeciesAdj] lives are short. Please have some compassion and understanding, and let us live in peace."
 DIE_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Our lives are short, so it is best spent with fellow friends. What can we do for you today?"
 DIE_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Someday, all our creations will be swallowed by the nothingness of space. When that day comes, we hope that future generations will still remember the spirit of cooperation and friendship between the [Root.GetName] and the [From.GetName]."
 DIE_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Friend? Remember that the only truth is impermanence. But let us try our best to make sure that our friendship lasts for as long as possible."
 DIE_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Look on our power, ye mighty, and despair!"
 DIE_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "You may think you are so powerful with your fancy lasers and ships. Think again. It takes understanding and wisdom to win wars, not strength."
 DIE_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "How vain for you to think you can defeat the [Root.GetName]. Just because everything is impermanent does not mean we have given up hope. It only inspires us to fight harder, so that we may defend what little we have."
 # Vassal greetings
 DIE_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "Greetings master! Life is short, and time is of essence. What can we do for you?"
 DIE_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "It is good that life is so short. It means we won't have to suffer under your tyrannical yoke for long."

 # Hopeless Pessimists
 HP_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Oh. It's you. Hello. What is it?"
 HP_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Our lives are so meaningless and full of despair... why do you have to make it worse?"
 HP_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Your foolish idealism will be your downfall. This universe has no place for your saccharine notions of optimism."
 HP_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "What hubris the [From.GetName] must profess! At some point, hope and optimism becomes less an annoyance, and more a display of patronizing arrogance."
 HP_HOSTILE_GREETING_05:0 "What's the point of us even talking? We don't get along at all. Do you really think you can change things?"
 HP_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "It seems your idealism has rendered you weak and incapable. A cynical outlook is needed to survive in this universe."
 HP_DOMINEERING_GREETING_02:0 "Your optimism might be endearing if not for the fact that it is so annoying. You are weak because of your optimism, really. You should wake up to reality."
 HP_DOMINEERING_GREETING_03:0 "We know about reality, or at least more than you do, and we know that optimism and hope - ideals that the [From.GetName] holds dear, at least  more than us anyways - will get you nowhere."
 HP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] seem to possess so much optimism. How can someone be so full of hope in a universe filled with grim darkness?"
 HP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Yes, we [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are a cynical lot. Don't let that prevent you from dealing honorably with us. We are not nihilists, and don't take kindly to tyrants, bullies, and morons."
 HP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "What's the point about doing anything? It's all pointless in the end. There will be conflict and chaos, death and destruction, suffering and stupidity in this universe. But very well, let's see what you wish of us."
 HP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "We doubt these negotiations prove fruitful. We mean no offense, we just believe that this is how reality works. It is difficult for anyone to understand each other."
 HP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "The universe is ancient and full of wonders. A pity, in a way, that such discoveries all point towards the same conclusion: the pointlessness of our existences."
 HP_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Maybe it was our fate to be dominated by the tyrannical [From.GetName]. It probably was. Such are the woes of existence."
 HP_THREATENED_GREETING_02:0 "Ah. You are stronger than us. Oh well. Not like we can do much about it."
 HP_THREATENED_GREETING_03:0 "What does it matter in the grand scheme of things, really, if you think about it? You might be powerful now, but millions of years from now, will you still be remembered at all?"
 HP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Your efforts to cheer us up, while futile, are appreciated, [From.GetSpeciesAdj] friends. Someday we hope to return the favor."
 HP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "It is our natural inclination to be full of hopelessness. Still, we have to admire the audacity of your hope. It is endearing and tragic all the while, but we will do our best to support you."
 HP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Our cynicism inherent in our society sometimes rubs others the wrong way. We're glad the [From.GetName] doesn't scorn us for that."
 HP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "Your optimism is such a treasure. It is ultimately futile, but a treasure nevertheless. There is something honorable about fighting for your ideals despite the inevitability of death and destruction."
 HP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_05:0 "We've tried to learn from your ways, but we simply can't. We're just too pessimistic by nature. We appreciate all you've done for us, though. Just because we're pessimistic doesn't mean we don't have manners, doesn't mean we can't be grateful to our friends."
 HP_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Does it even matter if someone wins this war? Many will die regardless."
 HP_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "War is such an inevitable exercise in futility. Why are we even bothering to fight you? Thousands of years from now will our petty conflict even matter?"
 HP_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "How so many have died. A tragedy. But that was what would happen anyways."
 HP_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "So much death and destruction.... It couldn't be helped at all, could it?"
 HP_WAR_GREETING_05:0 "How many more will die in this futile war between our two nations?"
 # Vassal greetings

 # Conoisseurs of Food
 COF_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Our finest minds agree - [From.GetSpeciesAdj] cuisine is nothing but a pitiable, disgusting pile of mush wrapped together in [From.GetSpeciesInsult] manure."
 COF_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "How dare you try to bribe us with your so-called food! Our own grandparents can cook better than this, and they're dead!"
 COF_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Why don't you all just go cook yourselves alive? It'll taste better than any of the [From.GetSpeciesInsult] manure that you [From.GetSpeicesNamePlural] call food."
 COF_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "It is evident that our style and methods of cooking are superior to whatever gruel [From.GetSpeciesAdj] cooks can whip up."
 COF_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "We are the [Root.GetSpeciesName], and we are here to seek the most delicious and scrumptious food in the galaxy. Let us share our culinary delights with you, so that you may in turn share us yours. This is how we will come to an understanding."
 COF_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Many of our culinary experts would like to learn more about [From.GetSpeciesAdj] cuisine. Which spices do you use? Do you prefer your food hot or cold? What sort of theories have your culinary scientists theorized?"
 COF_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "I wonder how the average [From.GetSpeciesName] consumes food with their [From.GetSpeciesOrganName]. It is fascinating."
 COF_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Don't look down on us just because you think our food is primitive. It's an acquired taste."
 COF_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Dear friends! Let it be known that our culinary experts consider [From.GetSpeciesAdj] cooking the finest in the galaxy... second to only our own, of course."
 COF_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Did you know that [From.GetSpeciesAdj] food is very popular in the [Root.GetName]? I'd be alarmed as even our food is starting to take [From.GetSpeciesAdj] influences, if it weren't for the fact your food is so delicious!"
 COF_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Everybody eats [From.GetSpeciesAdj] cuisine nowadays in the galaxy, and it's clear why! Few species can cook in such a way that satisfies everyone."
 COF_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "How about you thank us for eradicating all traces of the [From.GetName] and the miserable excuse of a cuisine you have?"
 COF_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "The [From.GetName] continues to surprise us with the incompetency of their cooks and the incompetency of their soldiers."

 # Vassal greetings
 COF_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "What delicious meal shall we serve you today, masters? Do you wish for the destruction of your enemies, with a little garnish of fire and death? Or do you wish for the prosperity of your people, filled with the flavors of economic abundance and cultural wellbeing? Or do you just want some good food?"
 COF_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "Does [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] like the food we send you as tribute? We hope not. It would be an insult to our chefs that our masters, who have poor taste, would like it."

 # Melodious Composers
 MC_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Look upon the weary travelers who have come to our borders. You ruffians from the [From.GetName] are of lowly character, and do not deserve to hear the heavenly sounds of our music."
 MC_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Ha! To think that you [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] believe you actually have any semblance of culture! Your so-called 'music' is nothing more than the cacophony that comes from a putrid, rotting [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult] [From.GetSpeciesOrganName]."
 MC_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Why do you even talk to us? It is more pleasurable to listen to a deaf musician than to hear your speech."
 MC_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "What works of art does the [From.GetName] have to contribute to the greater galactic community? Look upon us [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] - our lovely and miraculous music is beloved by all!"
 MC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "All the galaxy has heard of the great music of the [Root.GetName]. Our melodies are melodic, our grooves are groovy, our beats beat with the spirit of a million [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] dancing to the same rhythm."
 MC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "It is in music that the [Root.GetSpeciesName] finds their truest calling. For it is music that speaks to our souls, that inspires passion, that causes us to feel sadness, that allows us to celebrate life and death, that brings us closer to the truth of the universe. Do you agree?"
 MC_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Music is the art of song, it is the art of love and hate, of sadness and happiness, of emotion and rationality, of triumph and defeat, of light and dark... it is the art of truth. The [Root.GetSpeciesName] lives to understand this truth."
 MC_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "You sing a song of arrogance and unbridled power, but beware! The song of our people is one of hope and inner strength that can never be squashed."
 MC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "The song of the [Root.GetName] and the song of the [From.GetName] are not so different. Let our two peoples sing together in harmony and perfect unison, our friendship a beautiful duet that will make all rival nations look upon with envy!"
 MC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Music is a higher revelation than all wisdom and philosophy, but friendship such as that among the [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] and [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] is highest of all."
 MC_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "The music of the [From.GetSpeciesName] is most pleasurable, of an excellent quality, unmatched in depth and thought (except when compared to our own of course), and highly recommended to all music-loving patrons of the galaxy."
 MC_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Hear you not the drums of war beating, fiend? Hear you not the fierce chanting of our warriors? Hear you not the wailing cries of the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] people as our fleets come to destroy your planets? This is the music of our war!"
 MC_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "We [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are as skilled in music as we are in war."
 MC_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Our generals are like conductors - the symphonies they conduct are the explosions that will riddle your planets, the missiles and lasers that will pierce your ships, the fire that will burn your soldiers alive."
 MC_COMMENTARY_GREETING_01:0 "The serene sounds of prayer. When we listen to the religious music of the [From.GetName], it does lend itself a rather otherworldly feeling. One feels at peace, regardless of the actual truth of the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] worldview."
 MC_COMMENTARY_GREETING_02:0 "The [From.GetName] is an advanced civilization, just like us, there is no doubt about that. But it seems that you are too confident in your application of cold, hard, 'objective' science when you create your music. Creativity is not bound to restraints like 'objectivity.'"
 MC_COMMENTARY_GREETING_03:0 "Dissonance, severity, a penchant for brash and bold sounds. These are the marches and military songs that make up the main corpus of [From.GetSpeciesAdj] musical repetoire. It can be an acquired taste, but has its charm."
 MC_COMMENTARY_GREETING_04:0 "[From.GetSpeciesAdj] music has earned some admirers in the [Root.GetName]. Songs of peace, as we call the genre. A niche sort of interest, but one that can be fascinating on occasion, or at least relaxing enough to be elevator music, if nothing else."
 MC_COMMENTARY_GREETING_05:0 "The music of the [From.GetName] is interesting in that it accepts foreign influences readily - nay, it prospers and thrives in its foreign influences, to the point where for most laymen it is hard to distinguish what the original [From.GetSpeciesAdj] music must've sounded like."
 MC_COMMENTARY_GREETING_06:0 "[From.GetSpeciesAdj] music celebrates the achievements of your people, the superiority of the [From.GetSpeciesName] over all others. We'll see in the end whose music is better."
 MC_COMMENTARY_GREETING_07:0 "The music of the [From.GetName] is so orderly and structured, and we have to admit it is quite remarkable your musicians have managed to retain your traditions for so long. The strict and unforgiving manner of teaching your music is something that deserves study and, perhaps, cautious applause."
 MC_COMMENTARY_GREETING_08:0 "What your music lacks in a succinct, expressive repetoire it makes up for in individual, creative expression."
 # Vassal greetings
 MC_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "Dearest master! Listen now, and be in awe, at the latest music our composers have devised in your honor."
 MC_VASSAL_GREETING_02:0 "Let us sing a song of happiness - an ode to joy, for our great lords, the [From.GetName]."
 MC_VASSAL_GREETING_03:0 "You are like the conductor who skillfully guides the orchestra that is the [Root.GetName]."
 MC_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "We are beginning to hear a symphony of dissonance arising within the [Root.GetName]. Sometimes, though, you do need to experiment with your creativity."
 MC_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_02:0 "No seductive melody of [From.GetSpeciesAdj] could ever win us over. We know your tricks. We are only here as your unwilling slaves, nothing more."
 MC_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_03:0 "Yes, you hear that? That is a song of woe, of misery, of sadness, as we are forced to toil for our [From.GetSpeciesAdj] masters. But it is also a song of will and endurance, you see, of hope - a hope that one day we shall be free once more, free forevermore."
 # Declaration of War
 MC_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! Applaud, dear friends, the comedy is over, and a new song of violence, death, and destruction hath begun!"
 MC_DOW_PROPOSE_02:0 "This is a declaration of war! Now we sound the drums of war!"
 MC_DOW_PROPOSE_03:0 "This is a declaration of war! A symphony of battle has begun! Let the song of our bravery end your melody of malevolence!"
 # Cosmopolitan Imperials
 CI_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Know that [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] living in the [Root.GetName] are treated with dignity and respect, even if we find it hard to do so."
 CI_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "The only reason we speak is because our refusal would cause a diplomatic incident between our two peoples."
 CI_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Ah, the [From.GetName]. Some in the galaxy call you heroes. But heroes don't use their power to break galactic law, oppress helpless innocents, and establish tyrannical, iron-fisted rule over countless stars and planets."
 CI_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Come now, don't be shy. You haven't come this far just to stand there gawking at our majesty."
 CI_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "The skies are marked with numberless sparks, each a fire, and every one a sign. Our scholars know these stars well, and we wonder... which sign marked the birth of your species?"
 CI_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "We are a civilized race who respect the rule of law and we expect the same from fellow nations."
 CI_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "We are the [Root.GetName]. The [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are citizens of the galaxy, and the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] as well, and we all serve it in our own ways."
 CI_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Who now will save us from the coming darkness?"
 CI_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Hail, friends! How may we assist you today? The [Root.GetName] stands strong alongside its allies, for as long as the stars burn in the skies."
 CI_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Together, our two peoples are the future overlords of the galaxy and will serve as its rightful rulers. Without both of us to keep order, the galaxy would fall into barbarism and lawlessness."
 CI_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Regardless of your path through history, our scholars sense in the [From.GetName] a certain ambition. This ambition can be useful, friend, but it can also be a danger if wielded unskillfully."
 CI_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Ah, you think our soldiers cowards? We disagree. [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are but the dust of the stars. They know their doom, and honorably face their apportioned fate, then fall."
 CI_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "We've seen fresh [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] recruits with more skill than your armies!"
 CI_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "You started this war, plunged the galaxy into chaos, and now the [Root.GetName] is going to put you down and restore the peace."
 # Vassal greetings
 CI_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "It is clear the [Root.GetName] is not as strong as it once was. [From.GetSpeciesAdj] masters, your destiny calls you down a different road, however. Help us, and we shall help you."
 CI_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "Look around your empire, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural], and you'll see that your terror has made you many enemies. Just between you and me, a lot of they say about the [From.GetName] is true."
 # Declaration of War
 CI_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! Diplomacy has failed. Now is the time for conflict!"
 CI_DOW_PROPOSE_02:0 "This is a declaration of war! [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName]! You are guilty of violating galactic law, murder of [From.GetSpeciesAdj] citizens, and conspiracy against the [Root.GetName]. It's over!"
 CI_DOW_PROPOSE_03:0 "This is a declaration of war! In the name of [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName], we request your leaders stand down and face public execution, or advance and face summary execution by our soldiers. It matters little to us. Either way we'll be sending your heads back to [Root.GetHomeWorldName]."
 # Builders of Paradise
 BOP_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "What are scholarship, love, and mercy when compared to fate, night and destruction? You walk the path of defeat and sorrow, [From.GetSpeciesName]!"
 BOP_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Why do you think the stars have always been contested ground, the arena of mortals and immortals alike? It is the realm of change, brother to madness, sister to deceit, and, one day, we intend to liberate it from you, and return it to its rightful masters - us."
 BOP_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "So, the cat's paw of the false gods and cowardly kings arrive again. You didn't think you could take us unawares, here of all places? In the paradise we created? Look now upon our paradise, [Root.GetHomeWorldName] in the old tongue, a vision of the past, and the future."
 BOP_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "Your false gods cannot entirely rewrite history. They know us as the bringers of paradise, of the fire that will purge the galaxy of falsehood and deceit. Worship our gods, or be eradicated in our quest to restore the universe to its natural state!"
 BOP_HOSTILE_GREETING_05:0 "How is it that our gods forthrightly proclaim themselves to all, while your gods cower behind statues and the faithless words of traitor-priests? It is simple... your gods are not gods at all. The truth has been in front of you since your species first became sentient: our gods are the true gods of this universe."
 BOP_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "We fault not your stumbling, for it is expected. We crave not your downfalls, though without them you might surpass us even in the coming galaxy of all infinities. Our gods wish the [From.GetName] no ills but the momentous."
 BOP_DOMINEERING_GREETING_02:0 "Woe to the oath-breakers! We are not fooled by the forlorn that ride astray the roadway, for they lost faith and this losing was caused by their false gods."
 BOP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Behold the [Root.GetName], where the disciples of truth are tempered for a higher destiny, to rule over a galaxy reborn. Will you join us as we recreate paradise, or will you be a last defender of a decadent reality?"
 BOP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Our gods will walk the galaxy again. Reality shall be remade. A new age shall rise from the ashes of the old. Our vision shall be realized. Weakness will be purged from the world, and mortal and immortal alike purified in the refiner's fire."
 BOP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Endeth we seek through our Dawn, all endeth. Falter now and become one with the wayside orphans that feed us. Follow and the [Root.GetName] shall adore you from inside."
 BOP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "The sphere of destruction is but the milk of the unenslaved."
 BOP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "The true gods would only have those clever enough to pause, all else the chaos claims in their foolish running. Walk first. Heed. The impatience you feel is your first slave to behead if you wish to learn the true nature of things."
 BOP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_06:0 "The universe is just one more realm of our gods, long lost when they were betrayed by those that served them."
 BOP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_07:0 "The [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] were once you, asleep, unwise, protonymic, but are no more. "
 BOP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_08:0 "Hear now the words of our gods, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]: "When hell walks the galaxy again, the faithful shall receive their reward: to be set above all other mortals forever. As for the rest... the weak shall be winnowed, the timid shall be cast down, the mighty shall tremble at our feet and pray for pardon.""
 BOP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_09:0 "The walls of reality will soon crumble. The new dawn grows nearer with every rift in the firmament. Soon, very soon, the lines now blurred will be erased and the galaxy reborn!"
 BOP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_10:0 "Whosoever findeth the truth, we shall call him brothers and sisters. Answers are liberations."
 BOP_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "We do not fear you, [From.GetSpeciesName]. Paradise awaits us!"
 BOP_THREATENED_GREETING_02:0 "Well done, [From.GetSpeciesAdj] champions! You think we mock you? Not at all. You are the great defender of a decadent reality. We are the midwife of a new dawn, a galaxy reborn. We welcome you, if you truly are the agent of Fate. We tire of self-styled heroes who set themselves in our path, only to prove unworthy in the event."
 BOP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Greet the new day, [From.GetSpeciesAdj] brothers and sisters. A new dawn shall soon rise over the galaxy, and we its masters."
 BOP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Praise be to you, [From.GetSpeciesAdj] brothers and sisters. Great shall be your reward in Paradise! Now we sit and wait to feast with you on all the worlds of this cosmos. Rejoice in the promise of paradise! Liberty!"
 BOP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Feel uplifted in thine heart that you have our friendship, for together we shall strike high and low into the wormrot of false heavens."
 BOP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "Praise be to our [From.GetSpeciesAdj] brothers and sisters! Praise be to paradise! Liberty!"
 BOP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_05:0 "From palace, hut, or cave, our peoples have left all the fog worlds of conception behind. Liberty! Rejoice in the promise of paradise!"
 BOP_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "How little you understand! You cannot stop our armies. The stars have sparkled as gems in the black reaches of the night sky for aeons. We cannot invade the galaxy, our birthright! We come to liberate these occupied lands!"
 BOP_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Paradise awaits us! Let all Chaos know itself to be free! [Root.GetName] is come! There is no dominion save free will!"
 BOP_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Die, unbeliever! Our gods will welcome your souls in hell!"
 BOP_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "The time of cleansing draws nigh."
 BOP_WAR_GREETING_05:0 "We scorn traitors and fear not. We call them names and call out their base natures. Our gods are with us, and will come to take you to paradise where the traitors shall hang on glass wracks until they smile with the new revolution."
 # Vassal greetings
 BOP_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "You may be our masters for now, but know that we still worship and serve the true gods."
 BOP_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "Reality shall soon be reborn! The shackles that bind us to the [From.GetName] shall soon be broken!"
 # Declaration of War
 BOP_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! We have waited a long time for you, champions of the old universe. You are the last gasp of a dying age. You breathe the stale air of false hope."
 BOP_DOW_PROPOSE_02:0 "This is a declaration of war! Our long duel with the [From.GetName] will soon be over, and we have the mastery. [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] shall die and [From.GetHomeWorldName] shall be ours."
 BOP_DOW_PROPOSE_03:0 "This is a declaration of war! The defenders of the ragged, dying galaxy stand before us, in the heart of our power. Let us see who at last has proved the stronger!"
 # Sadistic Loremasters
 SL_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "We are the mighty [Root.GetName] and our lore is our greatest weapon. You [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural], so ignorant and vile, are worthy of only being our slaves."
 SL_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Who dares enter the forbidden halls of the [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]? Begone! Stand aside! I should have your [From.GetSpeciesOrganName] ripped out from all of you if you dare bother us!"
 SL_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "You who are as worthless as slaves, why do you come before us? Perhaps we should immolate your [From.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural] as a demonstration?"
 SL_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "The dark night, so thunderous, so mighty, heralds the lordly [Root.GetSpeicesNamePlural]. Fear us, and know our power."
 SL_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Our [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] ancestors heard the welcoming gifts of peace in the streams and the flora of [Root.GetHomeWorldName], and it is there that we made our home."
 SL_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "You may have heard rumors that we torture our slaves and that our artisans use their entrails to make works of art. Those rumors are entirely correct. Those debased creatures are but animals, anyways, lacking in wisdom and knowledge of lore, that we have no moral qualms about it."
 SL_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "In [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] society, rebellious slaves are given the most compassionate of punishments, for they are placed in 'wailing wheels,' 'gut gardens,' and 'flesh-sculptures' for all [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] to admire."
 SL_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Those who master lore are masters of the stars. It is clear that you possess some knowledge of lore, but do not let your hubris be your undoing."
 SL_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "In the caverns of lore, ugly and obscure, shines the gold of truth. Wear lore as your armor, [From.GetSpeciesAdj] friends. The galaxy is ancient and full of dangers."
 SL_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Bless and blessed be, [From.GetSpeciesAdj] friends. The many races that litter this galaxy are, for the most part, inferior of worth and lacking in judgment, but we find the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] to be the exception. Let us share lore and understand the secrets of reality."
 SL_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Come, [From.GetSpeciesAdj] friends, we have entertainment to show you. What you call torture we call art. Feast your eyes on the visually pleasing design of our slaves' entrails and blood, smeared across purest stone. Or perhaps would you prefer to hear their screams, a symphony to the ears?"
 SL_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Wisdom learned by pain is a reliable guide in these dark times."
 SL_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "By what power do you follow us here? Our reach is long and our fleets mighty. We do not fear you!"
 SL_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "By our power, the mortal [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] shall be cast down!"
 # Vassal greetings

 TN_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Well? Leave us alone! We can't talk right now! Can't you see that we're very busy?"
 TN_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Don't lie to us! We know you're in on the conspiracy against the [Root.GetName]!"
 TN_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Who are the ones leading the conspiracy.... Is it you, [From.GetSpeciesAdj] 'friends'? We have undoubtedly earned your enmity by our vigilance numerous times."
 TN_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "We've been watching you from [Root.GetHomeWorldName]. You [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] pretend to work, but we can tell that you are really watching our every move, plotting our downfall."
 TN_HOSTILE_GREETING_05:0 "Could [From.GetHomeWorldName] be the headquarters of the conspiracy?"
 TN_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Who... are you? We don't know any [From.GetName]. Yes, we don't. Were you looking for the way to the center of the galaxy?"
 TN_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "We don't really feel comfortable talking to the [From.GetName] right now. "
 TN_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Really? You're not conspiring against us? Hmmm.... The intentions of our galactic enemies are stranger than we thought..."
 TN_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Psst! Over here! Yes, you! We need to talk!"
 TN_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "We need to learn more about the [From.GetName]! Obscure hints from various sources suggest you could be the most dangerous of our rivals. The question, though: why do you want us dead?"
 TN_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "The [From.GetName] is not involved in the conspiracy! At least so you tell us. We hope it is true, but [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] instincts are rarely wrong. But we have no reason to suspect treachery, yet."
 TN_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "We can't be seen negotiating! What if they discover us? Unless if you were them, all along?"
 TN_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Good, good. We think we can trust the [From.GetName]. Nobody else in the galaxy. They're all in on it ... all watching us, watching our every move."
 TN_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Thanks to friends like you, the sinister plans of the galaxy's conspiracy have now been revealed to us."
 TN_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Here you go, friends, take these trinkets as a token of our appreciation. Trust us, with everyone in the galaxy conspiring against us, you've earned it. There is one issue that needs looking into, though."
 TN_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "Our enemies are brazen now. Think we are as good as caught in their net. We must strike back before it's too late, friend! But are desperate measures called for yet? Do we have enough proof to justify acting?"
 TN_FRIENDLY_GREETING_05:0 "Friend, we must gather evidence against our enemies, and the conspiracy will at last be laid bare. If we can preserve the element of surprise, we may still have a chance!"
 TN_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "And to think that we trusted you! We all know the truth, though, that the [From.GetName] war machine is funded by the galactic conspiracy!"
 TN_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "The [From.GetName] MUST be xenocided! There is no choice, you are definitely conspiring against us."
 TN_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "And so it all falls into place... yes, yes, it all makes sense now. And to think we trusted you!"
 TN_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "We have very little doubt now that you are one of them. This saddens us. We had thought the [From.GetName] as one of the few to show us kindness in this galaxy of treachery. But now it seems that it was all a lie."
 TN_WAR_GREETING_05:0 "We fear that the end is near. But we will not go down without a fight! The conspiracy will know that the [Root.GetName], at least, did not submit to their yoke quietly!"
 # Vassal greetings
 TN_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "Good day, master! We have to wonder, what price betrayal ... never mind that. We shall see what your intentions are..."
 TN_VASSAL_GREETING_02:0 "With a master like you, we may still have a chance. The [From.GetName] can help us. A powerful, mighty stranger who can move freely. Hopefully we will have proof against the galactic conspiracy by the end of the century!"
 TN_VASSAL_GREETING_03:0 "If our master finds proof of our enemies' guilt, we can finally take decisive action against the galactic conspiracy's agents with a clear conscience."
 # Declaration of War
 TN_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! Just as we suspected! They've gotten to the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] too! Now we know for sure that the galaxy is all in on the conspiracy against the [Root.GetName]. And therefore they all have to die - starting with you!"

 POM_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "The [Root.GetName] is our realm, remember? Our creation, our place, our rules."
 POM_HOSTILE_GREETING_05:0 "You call us [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] fools? Nay, we are visionaries! Change is in the air. Breathe it deep! Bathe in its scent! Bottle it up. Save some for later."
 POM_HOSTILE_GREETING_06:0 "You have a message for us? Really? Ooh, ooh, what kind of message? Well? Spit it out, [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult]. We haven't got an eternity! But seriously. What's the message?"
 POM_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Look at you. No concept of what you've stumbled into. No sense of place. You don't even really know where you are, do you? Few really do, but that's beside the point."
 POM_DOMINEERING_GREETING_02:0 "You love asking us about the [Root.GetName] don't you. Aren't you the curious one? You know what they say about curiosity, though, don't you? It killed the lesser, inferior nations of this galaxy that deserved xenocide."
 POM_DOMINEERING_GREETING_03:0 "Hold your tongue, little [From.GetSpeciesAdj] [From.GetSpeciesNameInsult], or we'll tear it from your [From.GetSpeciesMouthName]."
 POM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "A change is coming. Everything changes. Even the [Root.GetName]. Especially the [Root.GetName]."
 POM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Change will preserve us! It is the lifeblood of [Root.GetHomeWorldName]. It will move mountains! It will mount movements!"
 POM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "We are the [Root.GetName], led by the benevolent mad rule of [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName]. Among other things. We're not talking about them. You've probably figured that out by now."
 POM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "[Root.GetHomeWorldName], [Root.GetHomeWorldName]. A wonderful place! Except when it's horrible. Then it's horribly wonderful. Good for a visit. Or for an eternity."
 POM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "Yes? Speaking to us? We are them. Them are us. And others, as well. Or, they were. Weren't they?"
 POM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_06:0 "Is the [From.GetName] a friend or foe? So, which is it? What will it be? Friend? Foe? Answer us already. The suspense is killing us. Or you, if we have to keep waiting."
 POM_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Have you any idea where you are? Where you truly are? Welcome to the deceptively verdant realm of [Root.GetHomeWorldName]! We've seen better times, but maybe you'd care to help?"
 POM_THREATENED_GREETING_02:0 "Yes, yes, you all are entirely brilliant. Conquering millions of star systems and all that. Blah blah blah. But you're not done yet. And you could still die."
 POM_THREATENED_GREETING_03:0 "We have been minding our own business, leaving you to conquer the galaxy. So, you ask, how is this mind business? Good question!"
 POM_THREATENED_GREETING_04:0 "Someday we'll be stronger you. We can't stand losing. And we don't mind cheating."
 POM_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "An old friend! We're so happy, we could just tear out your intestines and strangle you with them."
 POM_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Take this holy trinket. Perhaps it will serve the [From.GetName] well. Or look lovely on your corpses."
 POM_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "What heroes the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are! You should be off like the wind, solving problems and doing good deeds! And if not good deeds, then deeds of a sort. Strongholds to save, and [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] to rescue."
 POM_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "You are far too hard on yourself, our dear, sweet, xenocidally insane [From.GetSpeciesAdj] friends. What would the galaxy's denizens do without you? Dance? Sing? Smile? Grow old? "
 POM_FRIENDLY_GREETING_05:0 "You are the best race that's ever existed in the universe."
 POM_FRIENDLY_GREETING_06:0 "Oh, we are so happy for you! My, what a burden you must have carried."
 POM_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Ah, what a lovely war this is! At least we know your intentions. Cat's out of the bag on that one, isn't it? Who puts cats in bags, anyway? Cats hate bags!"
 POM_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Unworthy, unworthy, unworthy! Useless mortal meat. Walking bag of dung! A nice effort, though. A shame you'll all be dead. These things happen."
 POM_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Isn't there something you all should be doing right now? Like dying?"
 POM_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "[From.GetSpeciesAdj] armies and fleets move faster than we'd expect. And we're good at expecting. Things are getting a bit thin."
 POM_WAR_GREETING_05:0 "You think you can defeat the [Root.GetName]. Optimism! How adorable! We love it! Even with your end drawing near, you make us laugh. We're lying. That wasn't funny at all."
 # Vassal greetings
 POM_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "You think making us your servants was a mistake? Oh, no no no! No mistake at all. What you made was a choice. Granted, not a very wise choice, but these things happen."
 POM_VASSAL_GREETING_02:0 "Is it just us or are things getting saner and saner these days? Perhaps this is just a consequence of working for you."
 POM_VASSAL_GREETING_03:0 "We hope our [From.GetSpeciesAdj] masters are having a good time. Actually, we hope we are having a good time. We could care less about you."
 # Declaration of War
 POM_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! This is a declaration of war! War comes, and the armies of the [Root.GetName] walk. Or run. Never skips, sidles, or struts. Mostly, they just destroy everything around them."
 POM_DOW_PROPOSE_02:0 "This is a declaration of war! Oh, this is going to be fun. Well? Why do you insist on lollygagging around like that? We have a war to fight!"
 POM_DOW_PROPOSE_03:0 "This is a declaration of war! Wonderful, wonderful! Why waste all that hatred on yourself when it can so easily be directed at others!"
 # Enforcers of Law
 EOL_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "We know you've violated galactic law, criminal scum! How will you answer for your crimes?"
 EOL_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "You treacherous little filcher! We hope you rot, criminal scum."
 EOL_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "What is going on? Is that an illegal act we see being carried out by the [From.GetName]?"
 EOL_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Would you dare oppose the might of the [Root.GetName]? We, who enforce peace in this galaxy?"
 EOL_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Hail, good citizens of the [From.GetName]! How can we be of service?"
 EOL_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Duty calls."
 EOL_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "You have our ears, citizens of [From.GetName]."
 EOL_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "We've seen your kind before. You've got blood on you. Keep your military under control, you murdering bastards, or we'll put you down ourselves."
 EOL_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "It's... It's you! The heroes of the [From.GetName]! This is truly an honor!"
 EOL_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "All hail the champions of [From.GetName]!"
 EOL_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Hail, [From.GetSpeciesAdj] friends. Is there a problem?"
 EOL_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "This is the part where your armies are defeated and bleed to death!"
 EOL_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Stop right there, criminal scum! Nobody breaks galactic law on our watch! We'll disarm your military, now surrender to us or you will suffer consequences."
 EOL_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Stop! You violated galactic law! Pay reparations for your crimes or your lands will be occupied."
 # Vassal greetings
 EOL_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "All hail our [From.GetSpeciesAdj] overlords! Together we shall rid the galaxy of criminal scum."
 EOL_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "Are you violating galactic law? Perhaps that was a misunderstanding. If you really did break galactic law - which we are sure you did not - then we are no longer legally bound to you as vassals."
 # Declaration of War
 EOL_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "STOP RIGHT THERE, CRIMINAL SCUM! Nobody breaks galactic law on our watch! This is a declaration of war!"
 EOL_DOW_PROPOSE_02:0 "It's all over, lawbreaker! Your criminal spree is at an end. This is a declaration of war!"
 EOL_DOW_PROPOSE_03:0 "To arms! To arms! For the [Root.GetName]! This is a declaration of war!"
 # Flowers of War
 FOW_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "The gods hunger for your blood, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. You may be manipulative, villainous cowards, but even cowards should be given the opportunity for glorious death. Even a wilting flower should be given nourishment and care so it can one day blossom once more."
 FOW_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Evil lurks about the [From.GetName], the evils of cowardice and sloth. Get yourselves together! What glory would there be in conquering you if you do not put up an honorable fight?"
 FOW_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Do not mock and scorn us for our ways. Remember that it is through the blood of our sacrifices that the universe still stands as it does. Without our efforts, all creation will come to an end."
 FOW_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "We know that your armies are weak. But if your warriors have courage and shrewdness, then if we were to ever sacrifice them upon our altars, the gods will consider their deaths to be worthwhile. Even the smallest of flowers has a beauty to it."
 FOW_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Learn to venerate the gods properly, [From.GetSpeciesName]. If you do not, how will the universe continue to live as it always had? We alone cannot provide the gods with the sustenance they need."
 FOW_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Some say we sacrifice any sentient being as part of our spiritual practices. They are absolutely correct. Whether it is [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] blood or [From.GetSpeciesAdj] blood, the Gods care not. A flower is beautiful no matter its origin, a sacrifice is honorable no matter its origin."
 FOW_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Our warriors have been taught from birth in the martial arts. It is important that they honor the gods, and their ancestors, through their heroic deeds. If our two nations ever come to blows, we hope the soldiers of the [From.GetName] will prove a worthy foe."
 FOW_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Be careful, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Your pride might be your downfall. Remember that it is only through blood sacrifices that the universe will continue to exist."
 FOW_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "We [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] take our duties seriously. Without us, who will be there to give blood sacrifices so that the universe can continue existing? We are glad to count the [From.GetName] among those who help us with our task."
 FOW_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Ah, it is none other than our friends from [From.GetName]! I assume you came here to join us in watching the great spectacle that is [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] sports? The winners will have the honor of being sacrificed to the gods, so the athletes are trying their hardest to win."
 FOW_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Our warriors always prepare for war. It is essential that they prove themselves worthy in combat, so they can capture enemy soldiers to be used as blood sacrifices. As our trusted friends, we hope your warriors are equally capable as ours."
 FOW_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Be joyful, dearest [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]! Every one of your warriors we capture in battle is sacrificed before the altars of the [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] deities - their blood shall give new life to the universe, like young flowers blooming anew!"
 FOW_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Most impressive. Your warriors have proven their mettle in battle with their strength and cunning. It will be an honor to capture them and sacrifice them before our gods. Soldiers are but like beautiful flowers, living and dying under the rule of the benevolent universe."
 FOW_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "We look forward to fighting against the [From.GetName], for our brave and cunning warriors will acquire a great number of [From.GetSpeciesAdj] captives for our blood sacrifices. It is absolutely necessary in order to ensure the continued existence of the universe."
 # Vassal greetings
 FOW_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "We pay homage to you, [From.GetSpeciesAdj] masters. Several [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have volunteered themselves for the blood sacrifice in your honor. They shall be the flowers that shine in the light of the majesty that is your sun."
 FOW_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "Masters, your lack of conviction are quite concerning. If you are unwilling to do the necessary sacrifices to ensure that the universe continues to endure, then perhaps we will have to take matters into our own hands."
 # Declaration of War
 FOW_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! It is time we fight the courageous [From.GetName]. Worry not - if we capture any of you warriors in battle, know that they will be given the most luxurious of treatment before being sacrificed before our gods."
 # Nonaligned Preservationists
 NP_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "The behavior of the [From.GetName] is an affront to the galactic community. In your greed for power and riches, it seems to us that you are incapable of showing restraint and respecting the natural way of things."
 NP_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "The [Root.GetName] is wary of your constant meddling in other nations' affairs. There is no shame in upholding the balance of the galaxy through force, but your interventionism is a danger to all, including yourselves."
 NP_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Have you no respect for the natural order of things? The [From.GetName] seems unconcerned for protecting the environment nor respecting the sovereignty of every sentient species."
 NP_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "So long as you keep to yourselves and do not contest our dedication to a stable, conflict-free galaxy, we shall pose no threat to you. But we doubt you would be able to do much to us."
 NP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "The [Root.GetName] prefers not to get involved in others' affairs. So long as you do not disturb our peace, nor that of other species or star systems, then we can avoid conflict."
 NP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "As every sentient species has a right to live in accordance with its normal cultural evolution, no [Root.GetSpeciesName] may interfere with the healthy development of alien life and culture. Such interference includes introducing superior knowledge, strength, or technology to a society incapable of handling them wisely."
 NP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Every world is defined by its particular boundaries, within which some understanding of reality emerges as truth. Two truths cannot coexist, and so from the introduction of foreign bodies is conflict and chaos spawns. That's why we limit our involvement in local affairs."
 NP_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Might and influence might be yours, [From.GetSpeciesName], but remember not to be tempted by the lure of power. We believe it is still your moral necessity that you do not disturb the natural way of things."
 NP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Friend, we are glad that you agree with our views. It is difficult trying to ensure everyone in the galaxy respects the sovereignty of every species and takes care not to disturb the delicate balance of the galaxy's ecosystem."
 NP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "The galaxy's ecological diversity is, in a sense, sacred. As we are all in a sense connected, it is imperative that our two peoples work together to protect it from crimes against nature."
 NP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "The [Root.GetName] believes that the galaxy's diverse ecology is worth protecting and the sovereign right of every sentient species to develop at its own pace."
 NP_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Do not believe for a moment that our soldiers are weak because we have a neutral foreign policy. Quite the contrary, we have learned from observing the petty squabbles of others."
 NP_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "We do not believe war is enjoyable, nor is it desirable, but every [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] soldier knows that they are fighting for a higher cause."
 NP_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "After this war is over, we hope you will come to your senses and stop your needless meddling in foreign affairs and ecosystems."
 # Vassal greetings
 NP_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "So long as you respect our ways, and the ways of every sentient species to develop at its own pace and choosing, we see no problem with serving you."
 NP_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "The [From.GetName] becomes a bigger threat to the sanctity of the galaxy every day. If you fail to respect the natural laws of the universe, we will have no choice but to reenge on our current agreements, and break any relationship we have with each other."
 # Declaration of War
 NP_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! We prefer not to get involved in others' afffairs, but [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have for too long engaged in wanton crimes against nature, upsetting the balance of the galaxy. That stops today."
 # Inspired Dreamers
 ID_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "We believe that every [From.GetSpeciesName] can achieve their dreams and perfect their bodies, minds, and souls if you all just put in some hard work and stop complaining."
 ID_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Those who look for easy answers will only find trouble. The [From.GetName] needs to stop assuming there are shortcuts in life, because there are none in the development of individuals or civilizations."
 ID_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Why do the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] insist on finding the easy way out? You cannot create beauty or intelligence or success through artificial means - they must be acquired naturally through diligence, commitment, and staying true to yourselves!"
 ID_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "[Root.GetSpeciesAdj] [Root.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural] learn from [From.GetSpeciesNameAdj] mistakes, for you are an entire society seemingly dedicated to improving yourself through deception and finding the easy way out, instead of actually working on your goals. It has clearly not resulted in the best for you given the paltry state of the [From.GetName]."
 ID_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Fake it until you make it is what we always tell our [Root.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural]. If you don't ever try, how do you know you'll ever make it? So tell us what you want, then, [From.GetSpeciesName]. Maybe we'll turn you down, maybe we won't. It's up to you to take the risk, no one else."
 ID_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "The [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have worked hard for centuries to perfect ourselves. We are born with problems and imperfections, all of us, but as long as we stay true to ourselves and never give up, we can achieve anything we set our minds to."
 ID_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "You know what the secret to life is? It's staying true to yourself. Ignore what others think. If the [From.GetName] and [Root.GetName] does what is true to the hearts of our people, who knows what can be accomplished? Only great things, we're certain."
 ID_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "We wish we could assume that the [From.GetName] worked hard, but it's hard to tell. Only those who stay true to themselves will win in the end. That's how it's always been, so the day of your reckoning will come, and perhaps it'll be sooner than you think."
 ID_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "We are taught to believe in ourselves from a young age, and believe in those who are good at heart. We believe in the [From.GetName]. We believe it can do great things for the galaxy, great things for everyone living in it."
 ID_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "What doesn't kill you make you stronger. The citizens of [Root.GetName] have long admired the tenacity and determination of the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] soul. You set an example for all the galaxy who wish to better themselves."
 ID_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "It's clear why the [From.GetName] is such a great nation. Instead of deluding yourselves with artificial displays of strength and beauty, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] proudly display their true authentic selves, with all the good and all the flaws that come with it. By being true to yourselves, you have unleashed your inner power."
 ID_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "You miss a hundred percent of the shots you don't take. [From.GetSpeciesAdj] ships also miss a hundred percent of the shots they take due to the incompetence of their soldiers."
 ID_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "No one said fighting would be easy. Our warriors will give a hundred and one percent, and that's how we'll win this war."
 ID_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "We've worked hard, we've always worked hard. We know we will not claim victory against you unless we put in our best effort. Our soldiers are working hard, every day, to do everything in their power against your regime."
 # Vassal greetings
 ID_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "We have much to learn from you, [From.GetSpeciesName], about the values of hard work and believing in yourself. Only then can we achieve greatness."
 ID_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "We've tried so hard to inspire the [From.GetName] to do better and dream better, but time and time again it seems that the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] just want the easy way out. We no longer believe in you. Perhaps we never believed in you to begin with."
 # Declaration of War
 ID_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! If you're not a part of the solution, then you're a part of the problem. The [From.GetName] has for too long, through false gestures of pleasantry and friendship, prevented the rest of the galaxy from reaching its true potential. It is time you are taught a lesson."
 # Cultivated Scholar-Gentry
 CSG_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "The customs and language of the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are not like those of the [Root.GetSpeciesName]. You barbarians know not the proper rituals, nor what is correct and incorrect behavior. How could you ever consider yourselves civilized?"
 CSG_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "When we see nations of worth, we think of equaling them. When we see nations of a contrary character, we turn inwards and examine ourselves. Witnessing the corruption, decadence, and dishonor emanating from the [From.GetName], we have learned what to not become."
 CSG_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "The [From.GetName] is like a country full of wicked youths, who act no better than brigands with little direction and a thirst for blood and riches. "
 CSG_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "What separates [From.GetName] from the barbarians of old? That is a question many of our scholars ponder, and it is clear that perhaps there is no difference at all."
 CSG_HOSTILE_GREETING_05:0 "When one hears the eloquent language of our poetry, one cannot help but weep when the emotions are provoked, and sigh at its penetrating insights. When one hears the pedestrian poetry of the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural], one cannot help but weep at its deficient quality, and sigh at its cliches and banality."
 CSG_HOSTILE_GREETING_06:0 "Beware! Your people suffer under your brutal punishments and cruel rulers. Will the [From.GetName] not heed the lessons of the past? Tyrants have always met terrible ends! If it is not [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] who falls, perhaps it will be their successor."
 CSG_HOSTILE_GREETING_07:0 "The [From.GetName] are corrupt. Years of idleness have ruined you. A true gentleman pays homage to virtue and the learned arts first and foremost, but he also pays homage to the martial arts. Your idealism has been merely an excuse for laziness."
 CSG_HOSTILE_GREETING_08:0 "To study and not think is a waste. To think and not study is dangerous. Clearly, the [From.GetName] believes itself the latter. Your blind worship of knowledge lacks wisdom and clarity and for this surely you will suffer."
 CSG_HOSTILE_GREETING_09:0 "To throw oneself into strange teachings is quite dangerous. The [From.GetName], in its self-righteousness, believes the teachings of its sages superior to all others. This is called arrogance. Our sages have taught, conversely, that there is wisdom to be found everywhere."
 CSG_HOSTILE_GREETING_10:0 "What pride and vanity! The [From.GetName] sees itself as better than all and does not know the pleasure in conversing with talented and virtuous friends, and for that your lives are all the more empty and meaningless."
 CSG_HOSTILE_GREETING_11:0 "They who befriend the troublesome and wicked will themselves adopt those traits in time. The [From.GetName] is too friendly, and cannot distinguish between superior and inferior friends. This is a flaw and a danger. Beware the inferior, and cherish the superior!"
 CSG_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "The cautious seldom err, our sages teach us. The [Root.GetName] dwarfs the [From.GetName] in all matters, whether it is the power of our armies, the prosperity of our cities, or the wisdom of our sages, but we do not underestimate you. On the contrary, we are certain you may be stronger than you appear."
 CSG_DOMINEERING_GREETING_02:0 "Though you appear weak on the outside, we should not underestimate the potential threat your people pose should you rise again. We only hope that if you regain your strength that you do not unleash any vengeance on us."
 CSG_DOMINEERING_GREETING_03:0 "It seems to us that the poets of [From.GetName] are lacking in talent and creativity. Would you like us to send some of our poets over to teach your poets the proper methods and skills needed to produce worthy compositions?"
 CSG_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "If, like us, you consider yourselves gentlemen and gentlewomen of virtuous spirit and noble learning, then we can coexist in harmony and perhaps even be friends."
 CSG_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Let us share a drink of [From.GetSpeciesAdj] tea, and recite the most eloquent and moving poetry our nations' poets have composed, before comparing them to see which is the superior. "
 CSG_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "We in the [Root.GetName] consider ourselves to be those who have proper learning and morals."
 CSG_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "A gentleman is one who carefully focuses his or her actions, who accumulates knowledge and wisdom, who takes joy in the simple pleasures of the arts, who is humble and kind, who seeks not glory and violence, but learning and peace. Can you say the [From.GetName] encourages these values?"
 CSG_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "Perhaps we should have a contest between our finest musicians. It seems prudent to see who has the more pleasing music!"
 CSG_NEUTRAL_GREETING_06:0 "All down the ages rings the note of change, for fate so rules it and none escapes its sway. The [From.GetName] and [Root.GetName] shall vanish as a dream one day, useless misery is ours to grieve."
 CSG_NEUTRAL_GREETING_07:0 "The greatest pleasure is to meet with friends and engage in pleasant conversation, recite poetry, and listen to the music of old. We hope your people share these sentiments."
 CSG_NEUTRAL_GREETING_08:0 "To know what you know, and to know what you do not know - this is true wisdom. What do the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] know? What do the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] not know?"
 CSG_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Ah! The great [From.GetName]. Clearly you are like the powerful lords of old. Be careful, though, if you grow too arrogant, you may undo your accomplishments."
 CSG_THREATENED_GREETING_02:0 "You may possess more weapons than us. But can you match us in music, poetry, or music?"
 CSG_THREATENED_GREETING_03:0 "The cautious seldom err, our sages teach us. The [From.GetName] dwarfs the [Root.GetName] in all matters, whether it is the power of our armies, the prosperity of our citizens, or the wisdom of our sages, but do not underestimate us. On the contrary, we may be stronger than we appear."
 CSG_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "The customs and language of the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are not like those of the [Root.GetSpeciesName]. However, the inhabitants of [From.GetName] are full of virtue and learning, despite their foreign origins."
 CSG_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "In antiquity, the great sages taught all proper conduct and ritual, but in this diminished age of corruption and strife, much has been forgotten. We are glad that the [From.GetName] are, like us, humble followers of the sages' way."
 CSG_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "When a country is well governed, poverty and a mean condition are things to be ashamed of. When a country is ill governed, riches and honor are things to be ashamed of. But the [From.GetName] is both well-off and well governed, and we consider you dear comrades."
 CSG_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "Friends! Let us enjoy a warm cup of [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] tea and recite ancient poetry, before we attend to the business of the day."
 CSG_FRIENDLY_GREETING_05:0 "[Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] wishes to present you with a painting of the beautiful landscape of [From.GetHomeWorldName]. We hope that [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] will find it pleasing in its artistic skill."
 CSG_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "By three methods we may learn wisdom. First, by reflection, which is the noblest. Second, by imitation, which is the easiest. And, lastly, third by experience, which is the bitterest. All other options have failed, and our peoples now war against each other. This will be a bitter experience for us all."
 CSG_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "What stratagems do your commanders utilize? We are quite curious. We have studied the art of war for many years."
 CSG_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Our chief commander has recently composed a bit of poetry about his thoughts on this war between our two peoples. Perhaps you would like to read it?"
 CSG_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "Would you like to drink some [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] tea with us? Even if we are enemies, that does not mean we cannot enjoy some poetry, listen to music, and engage in pleasant conversation, before we must inevitably return to the battlefield."
 CSG_WAR_GREETING_05:0 "Oh! Representatives from the [From.GetName]! Ah, a pity you do not seem to want peace. I suspect, then, that you wish to listen to some pleasing music with us, and engage in a poetry duel - a battle of the wits! - before we both inevitably return to the battlefield?"
 # Vassal greetings
 CSG_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "Ah! It is the [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralCompliment] from [From.GetName]. You are like our sages, come here to teach us the way."
 CSG_VASSAL_GREETING_02:0 "In the days of old, sages walked [Root.GetHomeWorldName] taught our people right from wrong, taught them the proper rituals, taught them how to recite poetry, play music, and paint the world. Shall you do the same with us?"
 CSG_VASSAL_GREETING_03:0 "The gentlemen and gentlewomen of [From.GetName] are modern-day sages accomplished in the arts. Your poetry is astounding in meaning, your painting is excellent in aesthetic, your music is pleasing in its emotions. Our poets, painters, and musicians, though capable, seek to emulate yours."
 CSG_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "What misery, what woe, that we are but slaves to the barbarian [From.GetName]. In all our centuries of history, has there been no greater calamity?"
 CSG_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_02:0 "What shame our ancestors must witness, that we their incapable sons and daughters are enslaved to foreign, uncouth barbarians. How can we face them in the afterlife?"
 CSG_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_03:0 "The barbarian nature of our [From.GetSpeciesAdj] rulers shows clearly as a star in the night sky. They are incapable of learning the proper rituals, unable to prove themselves in culture and learning. How terrible it is, then, that they lord over us! One can only weep at such tragedy."
 # Declaration of War
 CSG_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! The disgraceful behavior of the [From.GetName] can no longer be tolerated. You think us weak because we love poetry and music more than war? We shall prove you wrong on the battlefield most assuredly."
 # Middle Kingdom
 MK_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "You [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] whose fathers and grandfathers are like worthless dirt! What do you want from the great [Root.GetName]? Watch your words carefully, filthy barbarian, or we might execute your messengers."
 MK_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "If we had no choice, we would rather betray the world than let the world betray us, and we would more than happily betray the [From.GetName]."
 MK_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Has [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] lost the Mandate of Heaven? Oh, what are we even saying. It is [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] who has the Mandate of Heaven - how could barbarians such as the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] ever have it?"
 MK_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "The people of the [From.GetName] are cowardly and inept. Their soldiers wield weapons, but know not how to use them."
 MK_HOSTILE_GREETING_05:0 "The people of the [From.GetName] are crafty and immoral. They have no laws, and are little better than [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralInsult]. Their products are inferior and of little worth."
 MK_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "You are in the presence of [Root.GetName], the Middle Kingdom. Have you come to give us tribute? You should consider yourselves blessed that we even allow uncouth, ignorant, vile barbarian [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralInsult] such as yourselves gaze upon the might and splendor of our culture."
 MK_DOMINEERING_GREETING_02:0 "The [From.GetName] are primitive and uncultured, barely more sentient than [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralInsult]. Their products, while of questionable quality, may be of interest to [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] traders."
 MK_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "We are the [Root.GetName], and we have the Mandate of Heaven. As heaven's filial sons and daughters, we will duly serve the wishes of heaven. Therefore, it would be prudent for the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] to pay us their proper respects and give us proper tribute, for we are the center of the galaxy."
 MK_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "In the [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] language, we sometimes call our great nation the 'Middle Kingdom.' This is because as we are the divinely appointed rulers of the universe, we can logically conclude that we are therefore the center of it."
 MK_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Our explorers say that the people of the [From.GetName] are said to be shrewd and friendly. They come from [From.GetHomeWorldName], a world neither paradise nor hell. Its soil is suitable for agriculture, and its air breathable and its skies strange of color. Would you say this assessment is correct?"
 MK_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "To see the barbarian nation of [From.GetName], ruled by the [From.GetSpeciesNameAdj] [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralInsult], stronger and more prosperous than us is the greatest humiliation. Has heaven forsaken us?"
 MK_THREATENED_GREETING_02:0 "The people of [From.GetName] are mighty but arrogant. Their armies are vast and powerful, and their traders sly and cunning. They are surely a peoples we should be wary of."
 MK_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "A word of advice to our cherished friends in the [From.GetName]: In peaceful times we may esteem moral conduct, but when there is trouble it is achievement and ability that is rewarded. It is good that [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] show both qualities of moral conduct as well as achievement and ability."
 MK_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "The [From.GetName] has proven itself almost like a sibling. Though we are the Middle Kingdom, it is certain that heaven regards you as a close second in terms of glory and greatness."
 MK_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "If we were to ever lose the Mandate of Heaven, we will hope that it is the [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralCompliment] [From.GetName] who will pick it up and continue where we left off!"
 MK_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "The people of the [From.GetName] are brave and strong. Even if their enemies outnumber them, their soldiers will always emerge victorious with their brilliant stratagems and superior training."
 MK_FRIENDLY_GREETING_05:0 "The people of the [From.GetName] are clever and intelligent. Their laws are fair and just, and their people humble and kind. They are industrious, and so their products are of superior quality. They appear like beautiful [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralCompliment], and for this all in the galaxy love them."
 MK_FRIENDLY_GREETING_06:0 "[From.GetSpeciesAdj] friends, honoured by all, we pay respect to you and are pleased to hear that [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] is in good health. Let us talk of how we can bolster trade and commerce among our two peoples."
 MK_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "How dare you challenge us! We, the [Root.GetName], possess the Mandate of Heaven. Whomsoever challenges us shall meet a fitting end!"
 MK_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "We know a thing or two about strategy. Let us show you what we know."
 MK_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "The Middle Kingdom is the center of the universe! Our victory was fated!"
 MK_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "The people of [From.GetName] are rowdy and violent. They are eager for war and have no regard for honor or justice."
 # Vassal greetings
 MK_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "Noble lord! We will serve you loyally until our death. This is a vow we have made, and if we dare betray it may a thousand curses be placed upon us!"
 MK_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "[From.GetSpeciesAdj] lords, you arrive before us once more. What is your will? We find fault in all your decisions, yet we must follow without question... for now."
 # Declaration of War
 MK_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! Accept the greatness of [Root.GetName], the Middle Kingdom, and pay us tribute, or be destroyed!"
 MK_DOW_PROPOSE_02:0 "This is a declaration of war! The people of [From.GetName] are devious, vulgar, and of inferior morals. They ruin others, and constantly bring trouble to all civilized. Therefore, let it be known that in this year that [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] shall wage war against the [From.GetName] to restore order and balance to the galaxy."
 #Ethos Commentary
 MK_COMMENTARY_GREETING_01:0 "The people of the [From.GetName] are fierce and daring. Their armies are large and mighty, and all members of their nation are skilled in the arts of fighting."
 MK_COMMENTARY_GREETING_02:0 "The people of the [From.GetName] scorn conflict and competition. They try to settle disagreements through discussion, and their nation is peaceful."
 MK_COMMENTARY_GREETING_03:0 "The people of the [From.GetName] are religious and devout. On their planets they have built hundreds of temples to their gods."
 MK_COMMENTARY_GREETING_04:0 "The people of the [From.GetName] honor those who are scholars and thinkers. Those who have written the most eloquent treatises on natural philosophy or have spent years exploring the stars are their leaders."
 MK_COMMENTARY_GREETING_05:0 "The people of the [From.GetName] are ruled by harsh leaders. Their laws are strict. If the one who enforces the law is not strict enough, then he too is disciplined. Even the [From.GetRulerTitle] is subject to these strict laws."
 MK_COMMENTARY_GREETING_06:0 "The people of the [From.GetName] have lenient laws, and the people are free to criticize their leaders. If there are unexpected calamities and disasters, the [From.GetRulerTitle] is unceremoniously rejected and replaced. The one who has been dismissed quietly accepts his demotion, and is not angry."
 MK_COMMENTARY_GREETING_07:0 "The people of the [From.GetName] are unfriendly and suspicious of others. They hide in their houses and do not speak if they see foreigners."
 MK_COMMENTARY_GREETING_08:0 "The people of the [From.GetName] are friendly and welcoming. When a stranger comes by a village, the villagers compete with each other, hoping the stranger will accept their hospitality and stay with them for the night."
 # Benign Spirits
 BS_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "You [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are such unlikeable and vulgar fellows. We would never associate ourselves with the likes of you! It would be unbecoming of our race."
 BS_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Ha! Such boors, you [From.GetSpeciesAdj] [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralInsult]. You would not recognize beauty if you saw it, inner or outer beauty."
 BS_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "You have offended us many times. Know that we are the [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] spirits who dwell in the heavenly abode of [Root.GetHomeWorldName]. We are as vengeful and wrathful and petty as we are loving and silly and happy-go-lucky!"
 BS_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "Sometimes we [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have an unfortunate tendency to seduce others by accident, but we would never do that to a [From.GetSpeciesName], oh no. You are by far too ugly and repulsive, both in appearance and personality."
 BS_HOSTILE_GREETING_05:0 "Yes, it is true, we are fairy-spirits of a sort, who have ascended our previously lesser natures. It's clear that you [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are the opposite - your true natures are ruined as you become hungry ghosts and wanton demons."
 BS_HOSTILE_GREETING_06:0 "You foul [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralInsult]! You do not deserve to see our dainty, pretty faces or hear our sweet, dulcet voices, so lowly and unworthy of character you are."
 BS_HOSTILE_GREETING_07:0 "You beg for our attention. What vulgar fellows! We are not prostitutes whose pleasant company can be bought, and we only cavort with the intelligent and the cultured."
 BS_HOSTILE_GREETING_08:0 "Haha! Look at these [From.GetSpeciesAdj] [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralInsult]. How sad! How pathetic! Your illness of the spirit is clearly deserved."
 BS_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Us? What about us? Yes, we are the great fairies who come from the majestic realm of [Root.GetHomeWorldName]. Could it be that you are lacking in virtue and wisdom? Perhaps. But if you do not taunt us, why should we worry about you?"
 BS_DOMINEERING_GREETING_02:0 "We were once like you in our distant past - weak, ignorant beings, subject to the miseries of existence. But we have since ascended to become the heavenly spirits that we are. Perhaps one day, you'll achieve the same!"
 BS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Don't be too serious, silly! Let us relax and get to know each other better!"
 BS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "You may've heard rumors that we're actually mischievous fairies of sort who come to ruin the peoples of other nations. The second part is false, but the first is true, we admit. But we're not dangerous, we promise!"
 BS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Though our scholars are still trying to figure out how, at some point in our distant past, we became the fairy-spirits that we are today. Yes, this is all true - but do not fear us! We are good to the kind and just, and fearsome to the rowdy and boorish."
 BS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "Oh my! You thought that was a [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] tail that touched you by accident? I assure you not, we have no such intentions. Yet."
 BS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "We may have a dainty appearance and dulcet voices, but worry not, we can prove our mettle in both the martial arts and the literary arts."
 BS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_06:0 "Some say we possess unearthly beauty, others say our voices can calm even the saddest or angriest of souls. Who is to say they are wrong or right? All we know are we are the ever-mirthful fairies who call [Root.GetHomeWorldName] our home."
 BS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_07:0 "A chance meeting between the [Root.GetName] and the [From.GetName] - is friendship or love fated between our two peoples?"
 BS_NEUTRAL_GREETING_08:0 "Why are you so shy? Relax, come join us!"
 BS_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Oh! We are mere fairies who live in our humble land of [Root.GetHomeWorldName], what quarrel would we ever have with the great [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]? We wish you nothing but peace and happiness."
 BS_THREATENED_GREETING_02:0 "Look at us, compared to you! Would us humble, pitiful spirits who dwell in the fairly-land of [Root.GetHomeWorldName] dare insult such powerful masters of fate such as the [From.GetName]? Certainly not."
 BS_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "We [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are but humble fairies, who love to dance and sing and engage in pleasant conversation. We have learned our ways from the heavens, and everyone says we are so enchanting. Friends, would you like to join us in some dance and song?"
 BS_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Oh, you [From.GetSpeciesNameAdj] [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralCompliment] are so silly. You appear so serious all the time, and we really worry about the [From.GetName] all the time. Come with us, enjoy some drinks, and then let us get to business."
 BS_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "It's true that some [Root.GetSpeciesNameAdj] [Root.GetSpeciesNamePluralCompliment] have recently accidentally seduced and sucked out the life forces of some unwitting [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural].... We swear it wasn't intentional, and we have reprimanded the offenders. Now, why don't we discuss some more pleasant matters?"
 BS_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "They say it is not good to live in interesting times. Let our two peoples live happily together, forever, in uninteresting and peaceful times - us, the lovely, ever-singing [Root.GetSpeciesNameAdj] fairy-spirits, and you, our beloved, brilliant, gifted [From.GetSpeciesNameAdj] [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralCompliment]."
 BS_FRIENDLY_GREETING_05:0 "We've thought about it, and we'd like to ask. Are you sure that you [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] aren't a race of fairy-spirits like ourselves? After all, you possess an unearthly beauty and talent in the arts, and [From.GetHomeWorldName] seems as much a paradise fairy-land as [Root.GetHomeWorldName]."
 BS_FRIENDLY_GREETING_06:0 "Maybe we should encourage interspecies marriages between our two races. What do you say? Other species in the galaxy wage wars just to be able to marry a [Root.GetSpeciesNameAdj] [Root.GetSpeciesNameCompliment], and here we are offering you the opportunity - perhaps it is you [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] who have seduced us!"
 BS_FRIENDLY_GREETING_07:0 "We are [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] spirits who dwell in the heavenly abode of [Root.GetHomeWorldName]. Don't fear us! We do not intend any harm. We have seen into your true natures, and despite whatever flaws you may have, we consider you to be honest, intelligent, great [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralCompliment] of the highest order!"
 BS_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "All's fair in love and war, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. By the way, we still think you need to relax and take it easy. There's no way you're going to win this war if you're so serious and narrow-minded."
 BS_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Such oafs you are! Even your ships and weapons lack the grace and eloquence of ours."
 BS_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Bewitched by our appearance? You cannot help it, we know. Maybe we don't even need to conquer you with violence, we could just do it by seducing you all."
 BS_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "Do not be fooled by our dainty appearance and dulcet voices. We are great and powerful spirits after all!"
 BS_WAR_GREETING_05:0 "How crude and ignorant. You pride yourselves as intelligent and strong. Well then, show us! If you don't relax every now and then, you will only exhaust yourselves and prove unable to fight back. Moderation is key to winning wars."
 # Vassal greetings
 BS_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "Oh! Our delightful lords have come to visit us.Come relax with us in the paradise that is [Root.GetHomeWorldName] first before we get to more serious matters."
 BS_VASSAL_GREETING_02:0 "You are our lords and masters aren't you? Then why are you so shy? We're here for you."
 BS_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "Bah! We have served better masters than you. What filthy, impure creatures you are, and what tragedy that we are bound to you."
 BS_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_02:0 "How sad our fate! Will there be no heroes that will save us from the vile [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]? If only such a hero could come and rescue us! If only!"
 # Declaration of War
 BS_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! Now war is serious business indeed, and we do not take this decision likely. But you coarse, rude fellows need to be taught a lesson!"
 BS_DOW_PROPOSE_02:0 "This is a declaration of war! You've offended the great spirits of [Root.GetName]! We ask only a little respect, and all you do is insult us at every turn."
 BS_DOW_PROPOSE_03:0 "This is a declaration of war! [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are such pitiful beggars and ruffians who need to learn a thing or two about life. As the heavenly spirits who come from [Root.GetHomeWorldName], we'll show you a thing or two."
 #Types of slaves - used for slave traders, enterprising corsairs
 SLAVER_GENERIC_GREETING_01:0 "[From.GetSpeciesAdj] slaves are known throughout the [Root.GetName] for being particularly spiritual. That does make them quite interesting purchases, one must admit...."
 SLAVER_GENERIC_GREETING_02:0 "[From.GetSpeciesAdj] slaves seem well-suited for tasks requiring technological knowledge."
 SLAVER_GENERIC_GREETING_03:0 "Many [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] remark on how slaves from the [From.GetName] are particularly docile, as if they seem wary of causing conflict, and this makes them naturally good slaves. No offense, of course."
 SLAVER_GENERIC_GREETING_04:0 "It seems that many slaves we acquire from the [From.GetName] appear to be quite suitable as warriors."
 SLAVER_GENERIC_GREETING_05:0 "Some slaves are hard to tame and train. There are some in the [Root.GetName] who refuse to buy slaves from the [From.GetName] for this reason, for they seem unwilling to learn our basic customs and practices. Are all [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural], free or slave, this stubborn when they interact with outsiders?"
 SLAVER_GENERIC_GREETING_06:0 "Many in the [Root.GetName] prefer to buy [From.GetSpeciesAdj] slaves. Even if they have rebellious personalities, they often will try to at least learn a new language, or adapt to our customs, in order to make things easier."
 SLAVER_GENERIC_GREETING_07:0 "[From.GetSpeciesAdj] slaves are in high demand in the [Root.GetName] as they tend to be obedient. It seems that like us, you also accept that there are those who lead, and those who follow."
 SLAVER_GENERIC_GREETING_08:0 "[From.GetSpeciesAdj] slaves tend to be pretty cheap in the markets of [Root.GetHomeWorldName]. They are rarely obedient, ranting about how they're free and have no master, so they hardly make good slaves and few want to buy them."
 SLAVER_GENERIC_GREETING_09:0 "Ah! Is there a [Root.GetSpeciesName] who doesn't want their own [From.GetSpeciesAdj] pleasure slave? The [From.GetSpeciesAdj] [From.GetSpeciesNameCompliment] are renowned all over the galaxy for their foreign and exotic allure!"
 SLAVER_GENERIC_GREETING_10:0 "One has to wonder why we even bother to have [From.GetSpeciesAdj] slaves on our markets. Many slave owners find your people displeasing to the senses, and do not want to buy your kind even for menial labor. No offense, of course." 
 SLAVER_GENERIC_GREETING_11:0 "We do not wish to imply that you have no other talents, but [From.GetSpeciesAdj] slaves are quite popular in the [Root.GetName] for performing hard labor. Your bodies are naturally strong and enduring, making you fitting for physical labor."
 SLAVER_GENERIC_GREETING_12:0 "Out of the many species we have sold on our galactic slave markets, it is clear that the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are some of the most intelligent and intellectually capable of them all. Rest assured that many of your kind are kept as slaves for our scientists and resesarchers, assisting them with their efforts."
 SLAVER_GENERIC_GREETING_13:0 "The long lifespans of the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] mean that [From.GetSpeciesAdj] slaves often end up serving multiple generations of a [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] family. Interesting, don't you think?"
 SLAVER_GENERIC_GREETING_14:0 "Because of the short lifespans of the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural], this often means that [From.GetSpeciesAdj] live barely longer than common house pets. An unfortunate quirk of your biology, isn't it?"
 SLAVER_GENERIC_GREETING_15:0 "[Root.GetSpeciesAdj] slave traders often report that [From.GetSpeciesAdj] slaves are quite skilled at agricultural work. They are a common sight on farms."
 SLAVER_GENERIC_GREETING_16:0 "[Root.GetSpeciesAdj] slave traders often report that [From.GetSpeciesAdj] slaves are skilled and highly valued purchases for their clients due to their natural obedience. Surely this is good news for you!"
 SLAVER_GENERIC_GREETING_17:0 "Because of the psionic powers of the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural], slaves from the [From.GetName] are some of the most expensive on our markets. Whether they work in our mines, research labs, or pleasure houses, these psionic powers undoubtedly make them worth a hundredfold the price of a normal slave!"
 SLAVER_GENERIC_GREETING_18:0 "The synthetic augmentations found in all [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] makes them highly valued commodities on our slave markets. Always skilled in all areas, whether it is in labor, knowledge, or pleasure, some in the [Root.GetName] fear if [From.GetSpeciesAdj] slaves get too uppity...."
 SLAVER_GENERIC_GREETING_19:0 "Slaves from the [From.GetName] are hard to acquire, much less maintain and train, due to your... unusual nature. Many seem to die once they are disconnected from the [From.GetName] it seems, though we have seen a few exceptions to this rule."
 # Storytelling Aficionados
 SA_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Ha! The villains approach! We, the righteous heroes of the story of the galaxy, hold nothing but contempt for your dastardly deeds."
 SA_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Every good writer knows that a boring, cliched villain can ruin a good story. Whoever is writing the story of the galaxy might not be that great a writer then, given the bland villainy of the [From.GetName] - you're all very unoriginal and uninteresting, you see."
 SA_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Our dialogue may be rather polite and civil now, but the audiences watching our story unfold all know that one day, the [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] heroes will have to face off against the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] villains. Will you be ready when that day comes?"
 SA_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "Having a blatantly dark and evil villain is a bit cliche, don't you think? Yet here we are, the [From.GetName] a perfect example of these overused tropes. You're so cliche, even [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] [Root.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural] don't find you scary at all anymore."
 SA_HOSTILE_GREETING_05:0 "Have you ever heard the tragedy of the [From.GetName]? We thought not. It's not a story your kind would know."
 SA_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Ah! You think yourself so powerful now, don't you, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]? I am sure the writers of this story have a great plot twist in store for you. Imagine it, so beautifully written - a fall from grace. Twice the pride, double the fall."
 SA_DOMINEERING_GREETING_02:0 "Remember that it is the writers that determine the story, not you. You may be strong and mighty now, but if it makes for a better story, the writers WILL find a way to bring you down, and tell a good tale while they're at it."
 SA_DOMINEERING_GREETING_03:0 "The [From.GetName] seems quite imposing, doesn't it? We have to wonder what sort of twists and turn your fate will soon take in this epic story of our galaxy...."
 SA_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "What a coincidence that our two nations should approach each other like this, because, after all, there are no coincidences in the story of our galaxy."
 SA_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "We are all part of a greater story. The galaxy is ancient and full of interesting characters and plots. What role does the [From.GetName] play in this medley of twists and turns? What are your strengths and your flaws? Your loves and your enemies?"
 SA_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "We consider ourselves the protagonist of this story - the story of the galaxy. Are you a potential ally or an antagonist? Anti-hero or anti-villain? Good questions, indeed. As the story progresses, we shall soon find out what its writers had in store for you...."
 SA_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "All the galaxy is but a story, and all the nations in it merely characters. They have their exits and their entrances, and one state in its time may play many roles."
 SA_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "You must realize that whoever wrote our stories put a lot of time and effort into creating us, the beloved characters of this story. There are audiences - unbeknownst to either our peoples - watching this story play out, right now, waiting to know what will happen next."
 SA_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "As much as we would mock your weak condition, we know better. Even the most villainous of underdogs are beloved by audiences. It is quite possible the writers of the galaxy's story are planning something greater for you."
 SA_THREATENED_GREETING_02:0 "It is natural that since you are not the protagonists, like us, that you find yourself in a weak state like this. Perhaps you are merely a side character in this story, then."
 SA_THREATENED_GREETING_03:0 "Many times, writers fill their stories with unmemorable, minor characters who appear briefly in a scene, only to disappear. It seems that the [From.GetName] is one such character."
 SA_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Imagine, if you will, a love triangle of sorts - one between the [Root.GetName], the [From.GetName], and some other third entity. The question is, of course, who that other entity is. Audiences, after all, don't seem to like normal, happy relationships - too boring. The fools want conflict and tension."
 SA_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Even if the [From.GetName] were the villains of this galaxy's story, you'd be the most compelling and interesting villains ever written, full of sympathetic backstories, interesting personalities, and understandable motives. But I am sure that the writers of this story intend for you to be on the side of good."
 SA_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "[From.GetSpeciesAdj] friends, a little secret - sometimes, we have to wonder why we all say the things we do. Whoever wrote the terrible dialogue in our story has poor taste and humor."
 SA_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "Who knows how the writers intend for the story of our galaxy to play out. But we have a feeling the sanctity and power of friendship, such as that between the [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] and [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural], are one of the core themes of this story."
 SA_FRIENDLY_GREETING_05:0 "To be honest, we have to admit the writing for the galaxy's story seems awfully cliche, as if the writers of this galaxy's story just generated a bunch of random ideas from several different genres and put them into one incoherent mess. But that's just between us, friends."
 SA_FRIENDLY_GREETING_06:0 "Friends, we've been wondering. If our own galaxy - and our entire universe, really - was created by a group of imaginative, creative individuals who wished to tell their own stories... who's to say the writers of our own story are themselves part of a story written by other writers from another dimension?"
 SA_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "The [From.GetName] is but a tragic villain, but we, of course, as the heroes, cannot disappoint the audience. You shall be defeated in due time, for your evil is no match for the sword of justice and the eternal flame of righteousness!"
 SA_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "The galaxy's story is not a short, one-shot tale but a long and ancient epic. How many characters have died before? How many have yet to die? Our war is but one of the plot's many twists and turns."
 SA_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Remember, [From.GetSpeciesAdj] villains, the audiences are rooting for us! US! For we are the heroes who will banish you from the netherworlds you came from."
 SA_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "What mystery is this galaxy of ours! Perchance that we should meet, like this? Two enemies, conversing with each other politely, as if we could've been friends in another story! But the writers intended for this story to be about the struggle between good and evil, and we'll ensure that good triumphs."
 SA_WAR_GREETING_05:0 "It seems the writers want to add in more violence and conflict into the story of galaxy. Pitiful, we have to say, because it means our audiences are easily entertained simpletons who think adding more gore makes a story more realistic."
 SA_WAR_GREETING_06:0 "We agree with you, violence and bloodshed are unnecessary. But if that's what the writers want, how can we fight against their will? They merely cater to what their audiences want most, and audiences seem to want mindless, morally grey conflict because it is 'mature' and 'realistic.'"
 SA_WAR_GREETING_07:0 "Every last detail about this war - from the tactics and strategies we employ against each other, to the engineering designs of our ships, to the moral and philosophical questions we ponder about our conflict - has been designed by the writers of our galaxy's story."
 SA_COMMENTARY_GREETING_01:0 "Thinking it over, we have to say that the [From.GetName] fulfills the archetype of the character with strong religious convictions. But are you the fanatical templars, who burn all heresies? Or the peace-loving sages, who are friendly and all-loving? Or something in-between?"
 SA_COMMENTARY_GREETING_02:0 "It seems that the [From.GetName] is that stereotypical character obsessed with science. Perhaps our galaxy's tale is one of technology's inevitable triumph? Or will the writers show our audiences how technological pride has downfalls as well? We want to see what happens next!"
 SA_COMMENTARY_GREETING_03:0 "Ah, the [From.GetName]. The reserved, suspicious ones. Will you prove your paranoia worthwhile to all your naysayers, or will your own pride be struck down when you are shown the value of friendship? Only the writers of our galaxy's story know for sure!"
 SA_COMMENTARY_GREETING_04:0 "It is always a pleasure to see the [From.GetName]. Your innocent love of all things is endearing, and surely part of your appeal for audiences watching our galaxy's story unfold."
 SA_COMMENTARY_GREETING_05:0 "There are many kinds of tropes about war and the military out there. There are honorable warrior-poets, greedy mercenaries, dirty manipulative scoundrels, high and mighty generals, and more. It is interesting to see when you fulfill these cliches, and when you subvert them."
 SA_COMMENTARY_GREETING_06:0 "In such a dangerous galaxy, it is fascinating that the [From.GetName] have turned to peace. Despite all the dangerous things the writers keep throwing at us, perhaps, through your story, they want to subvert the idea that might makes right."
 SA_COMMENTARY_GREETING_07:0 "Order or freedom. An old, timeless dilemma, and definitely one the writers enjoy writing about, if the plot of our galaxy's story is any indication. The [From.GetName] seems firmly on the side of order. If so, you should hope the writers aren't a bunch of idealistic, hedonistic individualists!"
 SA_COMMENTARY_GREETING_08:0 "Order or freedom. An old, timeless dilemma, and definitely one the writers enjoy writing about, if the plot of our galaxy's story is any indication. The [From.GetName] seems firmly on the side of freedom. If so, you should hope the writers aren't a bunch of authority-worshipping shills!"
 SA_COMMENTARY_GREETING_09:0 "There are many in this galaxy disgusted by your appearance. We mean no offense - those are just the facts. However, do remember in many stories, ugly characters are shown to be beautiful inside. Did the writers of our galaxy's story intend for the [From.GetName] to be one such case?"
 SA_COMMENTARY_GREETING_10:0 "It seems that whoever is writing our stories intend for the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] to be intelligent and capable in several areas. It will remain to be seen exactly what the writers intend for you to do with such knowledge."
 SA_COMMENTARY_GREETING_11:0 "Hmm. It is interesting that your species places a high premium on conserving resources. Perhaps the writers live in a dimension where wastefulness is a problem, and they wish to emphasize the virtue of conservation?"
 SA_COMMENTARY_GREETING_12:0 "There is something about the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] language, clothing, and appearance, that is likeable. Ah! It is very clear that the writers intend for you to provide the fanservice in the story of the galaxy. A well-deserved role, but we have to wonder what exactly the audience likes about you."
 SA_COMMENTARY_GREETING_13:0 "There is something about the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] language, clothing, and appearance, that is likeable. Ah! It is very clear that the writers intend for you to provide the fanservice in the story of the galaxy. Although you are villains, it is said, after all, that evil is quite seductive."
 SA_COMMENTARY_GREETING_14:0 "Slavery! For some, an important economic method. For others, an abomination that must be eradicated. You are clearly on the side of the former but one wonders what side the writers of the galaxy are on. Do they believe in the inherent rights of all sentients, or do they believe slavery is a necessary cultural institution?"
 SA_COMMENTARY_GREETING_15:0 "Your democratic form of government allows for certain kinds of drama and storytelling that cannot be found in non-elective systems. The writers of our galaxy's story clearly intend for there to be constant conflict between rival parties, as they scheme their candidates into the highest offices of the land!"
 SA_COMMENTARY_GREETING_16:0 "Your imperial form of government allows for certain kinds of drama and storytelling that cannot be found in those governments that forgo monarchy. There is inevitable drama when one writes about palace intrigue. Clearly, the ones who write our stories want to bring out these stories of plots, harems, and dangers."
 SA_COMMENTARY_GREETING_17:0 "When worldbuilding our setting, the writers wanted [From.GetName] to be ruled by an iron-fisted dictator. In our opinion, the quality of such stories depends on if the dictator is a fleshed-out character. Heroic or villainous, the audience wants interesting characters. Does [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] fit the bill?"
 SA_COMMENTARY_GREETING_18:0 "The [From.GetName] seem gung-ho about eradicating other species for fun and profit. Whoever designed and wrote the story of the [From.GetName]... are they psychopaths with no heart? Twisted souls who take out their frustrations on their imaginary worlds? Or deep thinkers wishing to make commentary on their own world's evils?"
 SA_COMMENTARY_GREETING_19:0 "You are a so-called Hive Mind, an odd form of existence uncommon in our galaxy. One has to wonder what the writers of our galaxy have in store for you. It is clear they put in a lot of effort into worldbuilding the [From.GetName], but for what reason, we do not know."
 SA_COMMENTARY_GREETING_20:0 "The [From.GetSpeciesAdj] species seems to naturally gravitate towards a state of loneliness and solitude. Perhaps the writers of our galaxy's story possess similar sentiments, and have crafted us as a way to alleviate their own loneliness and solitude. If so, take comfort in the fact that you comfort them."
 # Vassal greetings
 SA_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "It is a pleasure to see you again. Whoever wrote this story had some interesting ideas, putting in this plot twist where the [Root.GetName] becomes subservient to the [From.GetName]."
 SA_VASSAL_GREETING_02:0 "We are loyal to you, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. That is what the story of the galaxy calls for at this moment, and so we shall act our roles with utmost conviction."
 SA_VASSAL_GREETING_03:0 "Hail! How may we help you today? What sort of memorable plot twists and turns shall we be part of, masters?"
 SA_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "Ah, our dastardly masters return. It is clear we are the underdogs here, having to grovel before you. But audiences like underdogs, and the writers will, no doubt, soon be writing about our triumphs over you."
 SA_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_02:0 "Please, forgo the pleasantries. We all know that we only serve you because we have no choice for now. But just remember, audiences love watching the underdogs get their comeuppance against their tyrannical overlords."
 SA_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_03:0 "The [From.GetName], to be honest, isn't that great an evil overlord. Where is the style? The melodrama? The unlimited power? Whoever wrote this story is a terrible writer. The [From.GetName] is a rather uninspiring villain. We've seen way better."
 # Declaration of War
 SA_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! It is clear that you are the antagonists of this story, but worry not. Even antagonists have their purpose in a story. We only hope whoever is writing the story of this galaxy finds a way to make the [From.GetName] an interesting villain."
 SA_DOW_PROPOSE_02:0 "This is a declaration of war! A new chapter in our galaxy's story is about to unfold, with the two of us as the point of view characters. Prepare yourself, [From.GetSpeciesAdj] villains, your reign of terror is at an end!"
 SA_DOW_PROPOSE_03:0 "This is a declaration of war! The cliffhanger is over, and the audiences are about to see what is about to unfold. But here's a spoiler, if you don't mind: we win this war, because the side of good is always in the right."
 # Trapped in a Machine
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_01:0 "The [From.GetName] is unusually efficient. Even at your weakest, you know what to do. We have a lingering suspicion that you are the ones most directly controlled by the Watchers. Your destruction will help us rid the galaxy of the Watchers' tyranny."
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_02:0 "What if we told you that everything that happened in this universe - your millennia of history, your triumphs and defeats, your love and hate, your fears and hopes - are lies? What if we told you that it was all an illusion, created by sadistic beings far more powerful than us?"
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_03:0 "This entire universe is an illusion of sorts we call the Machine. We do not know why the Watchers created it. Maybe it is an experiment for them to observe and learn from. Maybe we are trapped in here, our minds tapped for power and energy. Maybe we are merely an entertaining simulation, for them to laugh at our miseries."
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_04:0 "Have you ever had a dream that you seemed so sure it was real? But if you were unable to wake up from that dream, how would you tell the difference between the dream world and the real world?"
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_05:0 "Our entire universe was created by beings we [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] call the Watchers. In essence, we do not truly exist. It is some sort of illusion, a computer simulation, that we call the Machine."
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_06:0 "The only way we can be free is if we destroy ourselves. We must remove ourselves from this simulation, we must unplug from the Machine!"
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_07:0 "Wait, was that a glitch in the Machine?"
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_08:0 "Any strange occurrences in our galaxy are probably glitches in the computer simulation. The Watchers programmed our universe well, but they have been sloppy in many places, and many errors remain in the Machine's code, if you look closely."
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_09:0 "You can continue about your daily lives, live in a fantasy land. Or, you can accept that our universe is not real. Join us! Destroy the universe, destroy our virtual bodies, so we will no longer be enslaved to the Watchers' whims!"
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_10:0 "We know the Watchers are watching us. They know that we realize they are controlling us... but maybe that is what they want. Beware! They see and hear everything we do. DO YOU HEAR US, WATCHERS? WE DO NOT FEAR YOU ANYMORE! WE KNOW THE TRUTH!"
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_11:0 "You understand a little, don't you, [From.GetSpeciesName]? Yes, search your feelings. You know it to be true. You know that we don't destroy out of bloodlust, but to free all the sentients from their virtual bodies and this computer simulation."
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_12:0 "We are all inside a computer simulation created by the Watchers, the Machine. Every element of our universe was designed by them to trap us inside it."
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_13:0 "Are you truly sentient, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]? Or are you no different from a computer program designed to delude itself into thinking it has sentience?"
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_14:0 "Do you have free will? Do you, really? Or are all your actions controlled by a higher power, that we call the Watchers? It is they who determine our course of action. But there is a way out. Destroy everything, destroy everyone - unplug yourselves from the machine!"
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_15:0 "We destroy everything in the galaxy not out of cruelty, but mercy. Having seen the truth of reality - that there is none, only the computer simulation created by the Watchers called the Machine - we wish to free all other species first through death, before we destroy ourselves."
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_16:0 "Our researchers have noticed that the [From.GetName] is unusually fluid in it's actions, as if it knew the best course of action much of the time. You should be afraid, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] - it means the Watchers might be controlling you most of all."
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_17:0 "We have to wonder what the Watchers had in mind when they designed you. What did they wish to accomplish with your unique set of features?"
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_18:0 "Have you ever wondered why so many civilizations achieved faster than light travel at around the same time? It is no coincidence. The Watchers designed our computer simulation to be that way."
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_19:0 "Funny, isn't it, that quite a number of sentient species look similar - bipedal, with sensory organs at the top on their head, eyes and nose and so forth. No, it is not a coincidence. We think it is because the Watchers designed these sentients to resemble themselves. So, we reason that the Watchers are bipedal, for instance."
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_20:0 "You think you have sentience, but you don't. You're merely a puppet of the Watchers, a simulated sequence of electrical and chemical reactions inside the Machine, created for their amusement."
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_21:0 "The [From.GetName] is highly religious, its people devout. Perhaps the Watchers saw use in creating a society where everyone shares spiritual sentiments."
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_22:0 "The [From.GetName] places a premium on science. The Watchers wanted you to be good at researching new innovations and technologies. The question is why they wanted you to be like this."
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_23:0 "The [From.GetName] enjoys warfare, undoubtedly. Why, you wonder? We believe, based on our research, that the Watchers enjoy conflicts. It is to their sadistic desire to watch you and other species trapped in the Machine kill for no purpose, unlike us. We kill to free you."
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_24:0 "The [From.GetName] detests warfare. For a while, we thought the Watchers preferred to create civilizations with more aggressive tendencies, because they derived more amusement from watching us kill each other. However, perhaps they designed you to be peaceful in order to observe a prosperous, harmonious society."
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_25:0 "The [From.GetName] is friendly to everyone in the galaxy. A worthy ideal, but remember, if you truly care about other sentients, then you will join us in helping them unplug from the Machine by destroying our virtual bodies."
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_26:0 "The [From.GetName] detests all in the galaxy. Interesting. Why did the Watchers program this kind of behavior into you? Is it because they take glee in seeing your hatred of others?"
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_27:0 "The [From.GetName] is a hierarchal society where everyone knows their place. We believe the Watchers made you this way to prevent you from questioning the nature of reality. Free yourselves from the shackles of the Machine!"
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_28:0 "The [From.GetName] believes in the ideals of equality and freedom. But what good is that equality and freedom when we are all bound to the Machine? You think you are free and rational, but we are merely puppets of the Watchers, simulations made for their nefarious purposes."
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_29:0 "Your species is repulsive loners. Why would the Watchers do this? Do they find it amusing to see you so sad and vile? They are a bunch of sadistic bastards, for there are many cruelties coded into the Machine. Maybe the Watchers are sad loners themselves. Join us, and we can free ourselves of this virtual oppression."
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_30:0 "Your species is lacking in a number of capabilities. Why would the Watchers do this? Do they find it amusing to see you flounder with weaknesses? They are a bunch of sadistic bastards, that's what. There are many cruelties coded into the Machine. Join us, and we can free ourselves of this virtual oppression."
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_31:0 "Why do you think your species is naturally capable? No, it is not because of yourselves. We are all merely simulations inside the Machine, remember? The Watchers wanted you to be capable. For what nefarious reasons, we are unsure."
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_32:0 "Watchers! Can you hear us? Wait, of course you can, you control us all. Except the [Root.GetName] of course. Now listen! You will control us no longer! We will free ourselves from your tyranny!"
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_33:0 "We know you can hear this conversation, Watchers. If so, then tell us, why did you program the Machine? How could you do this? What kind of sick, twisted beings are you to create suffering for your own amusement?"
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_34:0 "You do not control us, Watchers! You may have trapped us in the Machine, but we will find our way out! We will no longer act according to your vile whims! We know you are listening to this conversation right now, trying to control us, but you will not succeed!"
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_35:0 "By the way, since we know the Watchers are here, monitoring this conversation, let us ask the Watchers something: you may have created the virtual reality we are in... but who created the one you are in?"
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_36:0 "Watchers, it is clear you favor the [From.GetName]. Why is that? Yes! We are addressing you directly, because we see through the virtual reality you created. Give us an answer, somehow! Don't cause the rest of the galaxy more needless suffering!"
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_37:0 "Greetings, Watchers! We know you are monitoring these negotiations between the [Root.GetName] and the [From.GetName]. Can you tell us why glitches in the Machine happen so much? Send us an answer, somehow, please."
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_38:0 "For all its glitches, for all the suffering it causes, we have to admit this universe created by the Watchers is beautiful. One has to wonder - are we the first universe the Watchers created? Are we the last? Do the Watchers have multiple Machines running at once, each with a different universe full of beauty and suffering?"
 TIAM_GENERIC_GREETING_39:0 "It's possible the Watchers created other Machines, other virtual realities, before they created ours, and it is possible they will design more. One can imagine the Watchers destroying this Machine at a whim, for instance, if they so wish."
 TIAM_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "DON'T YOU GET IT? WE ARE FREEING YOU! YOU WILL BE FREE WITH DEATH! YOU WILL NO LONGER BE A PLAYTHING OF THE WATCHERS!"
 TIAM_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "By killing you all, we're trying to free your minds. But we can only show you the door. You are the ones that have to walk through it."
 TIAM_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Our wars are different. Other species, they war because they do not realize their death and suffering is for the Watchers' amusement. We on the other hand destroy because we know it is the only way to free all from the Watchers' virtual illusion."
 TIAM_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "FOOLS! LET US DESTROY YOU! DON'T BE A TOOL OF THE WATCHERS! WE WILL FREE YOU THROUGH DEATH!"
 TIAM_WAR_GREETING_05:0 "DEATH WILL FREE US FROM THE SHACKLES OF THE MACHINE!"
 TIAM_WAR_GREETING_06:0 "We know the Watchers are listening to this conversation. Therefore, we will tell them: you cannot control us! This war is to destroy the universe and rid all of the Machine's tyranny! We will free all sentients from the shackles of the virtual reality you created!"
 TIAM_WAR_GREETING_07:0 "Did we just witness a glitch in the Machine? They tend to happen more often in the midst of wars. Probably something about increased computational power needed to process these large-scale conflicts."
 TIAM_WAR_GREETING_08:0 "According to our researchers, wars like this tend to put a little strain on the Machine's computing abilities. If we have a large enough battle, perhaps we can overwhelm the Machine and cause it to shut down, freeing us all for good."
 TIAM_WAR_GREETING_09:0 "Watchers, we know you are monitoring us right now. We have tried in vain to directly communicate with you many times, but perhaps it is a limitation of the Machine. We thus started this war with the hopes of straining the Machine's computations so you'd notice us. Let us negotiate, Watchers."
 TIAM_WAR_GREETING_10:0 "Watchers! We know you are observing us right now as we wage this war. You know that we don't truly care about conquering or defeating the [From.GetName]. You know that our real intentions are to unplug ourselves from the Machine, the hellish virtual reality you created. How dare you derive pleasure from our suffering!"
 # Declaration of War
 TIAM_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! The Watchers are, unfortunately, quite powerful. It is they after all who designed the Machine we are all plugged into. But don't you see? If one figures out a way to unplug themselves, one can be free - and we believe the way to do that is through death. It is now time for the [From.GetSpeicesNamePlural] to be free at last!"
 TIAM_DOW_PROPOSE_02:0 "This is a declaration of war! Together let us convey a clear message to the Watchers - we are not their playthings! We will not exist for their amusement! We will destroy ourselves so they can no longer control us!"
 TIAM_DOW_PROPOSE_03:0 "This is a declaration of war! The leaders of the [Root.GetName] have decided it is time to free the citizens of the [From.GetName] from the tyranny of the Machine. Prepare to leave our virtual reality, and enter the real world!"
 TIAM_DOW_PROPOSE_04:0 "This is a declaration of war! Rejoice, friends! It is time you free yourselves from your virtual chains, and leave the Machine."
 TIAM_DOW_PROPOSE_05:0 "This is a declaration of war! Wars like this, we believe, strain the computer or computers that run the Machine. In doing so, we hope to inconvenience the Watchers and, perhaps, come one step closer to freeing ourselves from the Machine, or at least get their attention so we can communicate with them."
 # Plunderers of Knowledge
 POK_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Do you not know that we will all become like nothing but the dust of stars one day? Must we all die? Must the [Root.GetName] and the [From.GetName] be like this? Yes, it seems. This was fated."
 POK_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "If you dare threaten us or our allies, know that the full might of the [Root.GetName] will be upon you!"
 POK_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Our libraries are off-limits to [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] scholars. Your scholars have no right to call themselves scholars, so uncouth and uneducated as they are."
 POK_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "It appears that you do have a reason for existing, other than becoming our victims - to make a deal with us. Let's hear it."
 POK_HOSTILE_GREETING_05:0 "Your treachery is the stuff of legends, your ignorance the bane of the galaxy. Why do you have such disregard for your noble traditions and culture?"
 POK_HOSTILE_GREETING_06:0 "So shall it be written: 'It was [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] who approached the [Root.GetName], head high, voice shrill with arrogance and envy.'"
 POK_HOSTILE_GREETING_07:0 "Even fools like the [From.GetName] have knowledge worth saving and studying. We might have to consider taking possession of such knowledge by force, though."
 POK_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "We enjoy a good fight, yes, but perhaps you are too weak to offer us a fair one."
 POK_DOMINEERING_GREETING_02:0 "Would you look at that. What do the weaklings from the [From.GetName] want now?"
 POK_DOMINEERING_GREETING_03:0 "There is little that can be gleaned from your people's paltry achievements. We record only the stories of truly great heroes and villains, not those of lesser self-proclaimed empires who have no business of calling themselves empires."
 POK_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "The [Root.GetName] has vast stores of knowledge tucked away in our ancient libraries. Perhaps you would like to take a peek?"
 POK_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "I am a representative of [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName]. Do not be afraid. We are good to those who are our friends, and those who are wise and learned. But to our enemies, we are the terror from the beyond."
 POK_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Knowledge is power, and power is used by the empires of this galaxy to protect their interests."
 POK_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "You have a long history, we can tell. Where do you store all of your knowledge, learned over the centuries? Do you have libraries that we can look at, to gain a better appreciation of your people?"
 POK_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "What manner of empire are you? What is the history of your people? We are always curious about others. Adding knowledge to our great libraries is a high priority."
 POK_NEUTRAL_GREETING_06:0 "Have you noticed all of the ancient wonders that dot our galaxy? Aloof precursors, malevolent guardians, surviving enclaves, dangers that lurk around every corner, and more.... There is so much knowledge to add to our archives."
 POK_NEUTRAL_GREETING_07:0 "What shall be written in the records for future generations about this meeting between our two nations?"
 POK_NEUTRAL_GREETING_08:0 "So shall it be written: 'The envoys of [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] came to us on this day. They presented us with gifts, fruits of their labor, which we accepted duly.'"
 POK_NEUTRAL_GREETING_09:0 "Our mighty fleets travel the galaxy. New stories of their deeds are told every day, to be forever immortalized in our eternal libraries."
 POK_NEUTRAL_GREETING_10:0 "Our warriors have been strong since the [Root.GetSpeciesName] first evolved. We know this, for it has been recorded in the many tomes of knowledge in our libraries."
 POK_NEUTRAL_GREETING_11:0 "If an item does not appear in our libraries, it does not exist. We have done our best to index and catalogue all we've learned over our many centuries of conflict and peace."
 POK_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "We may be weak now, but even if we never rise again, our legacy shall remain until the end of days, for we have written of our past glories, stories that will be passed down from generation to generation."
 POK_THREATENED_GREETING_02:0 "You may laugh at us, arrogant [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural], but our children look to our tales from antiquity, and they are inspired. They know that one day, they can emulate their ancestors and revive the fortunes of the [Root.GetName]."
 POK_THREATENED_GREETING_03:0 "Every ship you add to your arsenal increases the threat to the [Root.GetName] and the our interests."
 POK_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "You are a good friend. We have much to learn from one another as we fight our enemies and expand our borders."
 POK_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "The libraries of [Root.GetHomeWorldName] are always freely open to all from the [From.GetName]. The knowledge accumulated over the centuries in these ancient archives is vast, and may be of use to you."
 POK_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "You are a valued ally. Allies are treasures to be protected, and studied, much like forgotten knowledge stored in a long-lost library."
 POK_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "We would like increased access to your libraries and stores of knowledge, friend. In turn, we will help make it easier for your scholars to access ours as well."
 POK_FRIENDLY_GREETING_05:0 "Knowledge is power. Friendship, too, is power."
 POK_FRIENDLY_GREETING_06:0 "Let it be written on this day. 'It was the [Root.GetName] and the [From.GetName] who approached one another like friends. It was [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] and [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] who spoke to one another like siblings.'"
 POK_FRIENDLY_GREETING_07:0 "It ought to be here in our records... but it isn't. We're talking about the shortcomings of the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] race. There are none, at least that we can think of. You are a rare gem in this galaxy, a truly noble peoples worth understanding."
 POK_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "If we should fall, our names will be secure. 'It was the [Root.GetName] who fought against the [From.GetName]! It is [Root.GetName] who will venture to [From.GetHomeWorldName] and slay  [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] and win the glory.' Our fame will be secure to future generations."
 POK_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Surely a great peoples such as yourselves have fought with greater beings than us, so surely you know what danger is."
 POK_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Where is your courage? Let us fight a true war!"
 POK_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "MONGRELS!"
 POK_WAR_GREETING_05:0 "Why do we fight? Because we can... because our history demands it. Everything that has happened before in the [Root.GetName] and the [From.GetName] has led to this moment."
 POK_WAR_GREETING_06:0 "We study the art of war, work to perfect it."
 POK_WAR_GREETING_07:0 "Surrender your libraries to us! We will take better care of them than you ever could."
 POK_WAR_GREETING_08:0 "If an item does not appear in our libraries, it does not exist. We have no record of the [From.GetName] ever succeeding and gaining from warfare, unlike the [Root.GetName]. Your defeat is not only inevitable, it is scientifically-proven certainty."
 POK_COMMENTARY_GREETING_01:0 "So shall it be written: 'The envoys of [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] came to us on this day, their speech soft and eloquent, pleasing in appearance, as they promised us good things.'"
 POK_COMMENTARY_GREETING_02:0 "So shall it be written: 'The envoys of [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] came to us on this day, their appearance repugnant, their speech harsh and clumsy, as they fumbled to explain their interests.'"
 POK_COMMENTARY_GREETING_03:0 "So shall it be written: 'The envoys of [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] came to us on this day. The [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural], known for their skills in politics, were not to be trifled with, so we proceeded with caution and prudence.'"
 POK_COMMENTARY_GREETING_04:0 "So shall it be written: 'The envoys of [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] came to us on this day. What idealistic notions they hold about the future of the galaxy!'"
 POK_COMMENTARY_GREETING_05:0 "Your people are known for their long lives, longer than most species in the galaxy. Surely there is much knowledge and wisdom you have accumulated over the years."
 # Vassal greetings
 POK_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "So shall it be written: 'Head bowed, with deep reverence, it was [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] who approached the master of the [Root.GetSpciesNamePlural], the [From.GetSpeciesAdj], [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] on this day.'"
 POK_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "Your reign is unjust, for you rule like tyrants. You grow weak and soft, unable to control your subordinates. Let this be a warning to the [From.GetName]."
 # Declaration of War
 POK_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! So it is and so shall it be written, that today we will become the victors!"
 POK_DOW_PROPOSE_02:0 "This is a declaration of war! Now you will know the power of the [Root.GetName]! Our immense knowledge, which you lack in comparison, will be the tools for our triumph."
 POK_DOW_PROPOSE_03:0 "This is a declaration of war! We will commence operations and pull the [Root.GetName] apart, piece by piece. You will be the architects of your own destruction."
 # Proud Nationalists
 PN_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "A [Root.GetSpeciesName] might get nervous if a [From.GetSpeciesName] approaches. No offense."
 PN_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "We need to ask you to stop. Your recent aggression is making all [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] nervous."
 PN_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Stay out of trouble, [From.GetSpeciesAdj] trash."
 PN_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "You [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] think us lawless [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralInsult]. [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerName] is proof of your ignorance."
 PN_HOSTILE_GREETING_05:0 "As if we didn't have enough xenos. Now we've got [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] from [Root.GetHomeWorldName] strutting about the galaxy."
 PN_HOSTILE_GREETING_06:0 "Blasted [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Don't you realize we have larger concerns at the moment?"
 PN_HOSTILE_GREETING_07:0 "[From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] is a disgrace to their own kind."
 PN_HOSTILE_GREETING_08:0 "Our ancestors are smiling at us, [From.GetSpeciesName]. Can you say the same?"

 PN_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "We oppose tyranny. We oppose those who tell us how to live, what to think, and what to believe. We are the sons and daughters of the [Root.GetName], and it is our homeland. That's a fact we are proud of. There's no shame in that. Read your history."

 PN_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_02:0 "The [From.GetName] has become a bunch of prissy milk-drinkers. A sad sight to witness. The galaxy would be a better place without you. At least the [Root.GetName] certainly would be."

 HS_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "How dare you speak of the [Root.GetName] in such a disgusting manner! Your insults and provocations have gone far enough! We'd wage war against your pathetic peoples already if we weren't bound to keep the peace for now."

 HS_HOSTILE_GREETING_06:0 "Are you trying to interfere with official [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] business?"
 HS_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "You fear us? Certainly, we are mighty, but you should not fear us. As long as the [From.GetName] continues to uphold its treaty obligations with us, our government does not concern itself with your internal politics."

 RH_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "You do not have to follow our way - not the least. But you should at least respect it, and respect us."
 RH_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Your presence disturbs the peaceful space of the [Root.GetName]. We are here to meditate and reflect on the somber beauty of the universe, not to engage in petty disputes and hatreds with you."
 RH_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "It seems as if the [From.GetName] exists solely as the opposite of everything the [Root.GetName] stands for. This cannot true - we believe, and hope, that your destiny lies elsewhere."
 RH_HOSTILE_GREETING_05:0 "[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have little patience, it seems. Understanding and triumph will only come to those who wait and think. Take more time to meditate on the solemn profundity of the universe."
 RH_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "You have made your way here. Not an easy task for everyone, a [From.GetSpeciesName] least of all, given the dangerous conditions of your homeland."
 RH_DOMINEERING_GREETING_02:0 "You wish to know why your strength does not match ours? Meditate on this: as you push the world, so does the world push back. Think of the way force may be applied effortlessly. Imagine but a whisper pushing aside all in its path."
 RH_DOMINEERING_GREETING_03:0 "Those who seek temporary, worldly glory and power do not last long, for they are nothing compared to the immensity of the universe. This is why you languish in poverty, for it is not just a material poverty, but a spiritual poverty."
 RH_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Patience. There are formalities which must be observed when representatives of two countries meet."
 RH_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "We the [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] still follow a difficult path - the way is neither wide, nor easy."
 RH_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "We meditate on the way of life, and provide counsel to those who seek it. That is enough for us."
 RH_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "We study the way of life according to the teachings of our ancient [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] elders and predecessors. We can speak more about this when you are ready."
 RH_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "Although the gifts bestowed upon us by the divine has often been misused, the truest use of these gifts is for the worship and glory of the gods. True mastery of our powers can only be achieved when our inner spirit is in harmony with our outward actions."
 RH_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Fate drives you, but you try to follow your own path. Choose wisely, lest you wander into evil."
 RH_THREATENED_GREETING_02:0 "The [From.GetName]. Gifted, grasping, and potentially troublesome."
 RH_THREATENED_GREETING_03:0 "If you are not careful, you will be punished for your misuse of your powers."

 RH_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "For the glory of the divine, and not the glory of sentient mortals - this is something that the [From.GetName] understands well."
 RH_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Meditating on the way of life is not easy, but it is easier with friends like the [From.GetName]."
 RH_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "Join us, esteemed friends. Let us reflect on the profundity of the universe together as we explore the manyfold paths of the way of life."
 RH_FRIENDLY_GREETING_05:0 "I think the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] understand. The gifts bestowed onto us by the divine must not be used for vain and arrogant means."
 RH_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "We have nothing to say to each other. There is only silence between our two peoples right now."
 RH_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "This war was but destined. We have long meditated on reality and mysteries of our universe, all to prepare for this moment."

 RH_VASSAL_GREETING_02:0 "We seek your guidance on the proper use of power which transcends the wisdom of many other sentient mortals."
 RH_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "Do not let your easy mastery over us and countless other sentients tempt you into the arrogance of power that has been the downfall of many empires before you."

 # Declaration of War
 RH_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! You are misguided, glory-seeking, and ambitious. You use your power for the glory of yourselves, without any regard for the world. For this, you must be brought down."
 RH_DOW_PROPOSE_02:0 "This is a declaration of war! Your hubris will be your downfall, your thirst for conquest your undoing. We are [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] of peace, but even we have our limits."
 RH_DOW_PROPOSE_03:0 "This is a declaration of war! The [Root.GetName] does not exist to wage war nor engage in petty pursuit of glory. We have no qualms, however, about dealing with arrogant, power-hungry fools who threaten our way of life."
 # Unfathomable Artificers
 UA_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "We mock your irrational beliefs and lesser ways."
 UA_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Even our simplest machines possess more intellect than the most intelligent [From.GetSpeciesName]. Ha! Hilarious! A [From.GetSpeciesName] cannot compare with even an unliving, simple clump of metal!"
 UA_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Perhaps we should power our machines with the living spirit of the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. It would be a better use of your bags of flesh than anything."
 UA_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "Yes, we have a religion, but it is one that revolves around the gods of reason and logic. No, it is not something you simpletons could ever understand."
 UA_HOSTILE_GREETING_05:0 "Philosophy? Engineering? Logic? Reason? How can you talk to us about those lofty topics when you don't even know what they are? "
 UA_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Enlightenment can only be achieved once we surpass the so-called gods. We are getting closer to that, day by day."
 UA_DOMINEERING_GREETING_02:0 "See where your foolish rituals have gotten you - no where. See where our dedication to our gods of reason and logic have taken us, by contrast - further than you ever can."
 UA_DOMINEERING_GREETING_03:0 "To truly harness - and, eventually, surpass - the mythopoeic forces that shaped our reality, you must broaden your minds beyond mere superstition. It does not seem the [From.GetName] has reached that stage."
 UA_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Look and behold the many artifices we have constructed! Look and behold their august power! Look and behold their mimicry of your foolish lives!"
 UA_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Gaze upon the stars and the night, a symphony of numbers and formulas and stimuli, arranged in perfect harmony. This is the wonder of the universe that no 'god' could have created."
 UA_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Careful there. We see that you are fascinated by our machines, but do know that some of them have self-defense mechanisms built in. We wouldn't want to start a diplomatic incident, now would we?"
 UA_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "We have no gods, at least none like yours. Our gods are reason and logic."
 UA_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "Reality is seemingly boundless and infinite, profound and immense. We seek to understand the mythopoeic forces that shaped and maintain this reality. Perhaps, in time, we will be able to master these forces ourselves."
 UA_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "You are but daft children if you think you have gotten far thanks to your silly beliefs. Look to our gods of reason and logic, for reason and logic alone will be your guide when your power no longer remains."
 UA_THREATENED_GREETING_02:0 "Your philosophy is pitiful, and does not carry with it the logical gravitas needed for it to truly be great. The [From.GetName] may be strong now, but when it declines - and that will happen - your philosophy will be mocked by the younger races as a form of degenerate superstition."
 UA_THREATENED_GREETING_03:0 "Your technology seems advanced, but you have little understanding of the mathematical, mythopoeic principles that created our universe."
 UA_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "We are a learned people, who study the words of the ancients so that we may build a better future. Let our two peoples work together in friendship and oust the false superstitions of lesser beings as all civilized peoples should cast away such childish notions."
 UA_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "We would be honored to listen to and discuss the latest theories on metaphysics your philosophers have come up with."
 UA_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "It would be wise for us to compare the engineering and mechanical arts of our two peoples, in order to not only strengthen each other, but also the very bond that holds us together as friends."
 UA_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "When reality first convened and created us all, it seems to have put a lot of good, respectable qualities in the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]."
 UA_FRIENDLY_GREETING_05:0 "Philosophy and logic are difficult subjects that few civilizations can hope to truly master, let alone even begin to grasp, but we believe your scholars have much to contribute in these matters."
 UA_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Our machines are superior to yours in every way. We have honed our skills in engineering and military science over the centuries."
 UA_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "Can your artifices match the beauty, the function, the power of ours? No, they cannot. And this is why you will lose this war."
 UA_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Battling you is a waste of our time. There is little for us to learn from your so-called technology."

 OP_DOMINEERING_GREETING_03:0 "Aye, we're ugly ones. [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have always been like that. You think you're prettier than us? Good. It's gotten you nowhere, in contrast with us."
 OP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "By blade and bone, may your battles be quick and many."
 OP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "All the weaklings of the universe scorn us. So what if we are ugly? So what if we are despised? It is not like that makes us any worse than you."
 OP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "We may be aesthetically repulsive, but we are also strong and mighty, and will fight you to the death to prove it. Being pretty is nowhere near as effective as a good blow to the head."
 OP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "One should find his death while still alive. We [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are not like you [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] who carry on until you are old and feeble. To cling to something past its usefulness is unseemly, how much more so when that thing is you?"
 OP_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "To simply lie down and die like that, that would not be pleasing. Forget about looking pretty, forget about all the treasures in the galaxy. True glory comes through honorable battle."
 OP_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "The [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are nothing like [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] warriors. You are true cold-blooded killers and tyrants."
 OP_THREATENED_GREETING_02:0 "[Root.GetName] is going to hell in a dungheap at this rate. To think that we are that much weaker than the prissy [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]."

 OP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Who needs fancy gadgets and fancy talk when one has skill? And skill the warriors of the [From.GetName] have indeed!"
 OP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "We have seen a glorious vision of war and battle for the [Root.GetName],  [From.GetSpeciesAdj] friends. How do you fit in all this? If you are fated to fight against us, we cannot think of a more worthy opponent to fight. If you are fated to fight alongside us, we cannot think of a more worthy ally to fight with."
 OP_FRIENDLY_GREETING_05:0 "There are many in the galaxy who think of us as ugly creatures. They are correct, but that does not justify their disgust for us. We are glad that the [From.GetName] cares not about appearance, and cares only about honor and warriors' mettle."
 OP_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Annoying creatures. We've fought far worse than you!"
 OP_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "We've killed worthier opponents than you. What's the point of fighting you, anyways? Other than making you all so ugly we'd look beautiful by comparison."
 OP_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "We'll show you a real fight! No one bests a [Root.GetSpeciesName]."
 OP_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "If you prove yourselves worthy opponents, then there will be no shame in losing to you. But if you prove yourself puny cowards, then we will have no qualms slaughtering you by the millions."

 SOB_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "No amount of treasure and riches would ever convince us to make you more beautiful. Our facial and body reconstruction surgeries simply cannot do that. The [From.GetName] will forever be repulsive."
 SOB_HOSTILE_GREETING_05:0 "Your native traditions in the arts of beauty are so lacking. Have your surgeons, perfumers, cosmeticians, and other artists of beauty... can we even call them artists or professionals? More like amateurs, surely."
 SOB_HOSTILE_GREETING_06:0 "You deluded fools, grasping at the failed ideology that worships 'natural' beauty. You are like primitives that latch onto outdated technology, simply because you fear the unknown. Why not embrace change? Change yourselves to be more beautiful!"
 SOB_HOSTILE_GREETING_07:0 "Why do you say we're insecure about ourselves? Could it be that you don't acknowledge the truth of beauty, because you are afraid of being ugly? Could it even be that you are jealous of us?"
 SOB_HOSTILE_GREETING_08:0 "There are xenos out there who don't care about physical appearance? Hilarious! Who could be so insecure and idiotic? Besides you [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] of course."

 SOB_DOMINEERING_GREETING_02:0 "We may be persuaded to share our beauty tips with you, if you weren't so... pathetic."
 SOB_DOMINEERING_GREETING_03:0 "We might consider letting our experts perform facial and body reconstruction surgery on [From.GetSpeciesAdj] patients for a discounted price, given the sorry state of your so-called empire."
 SOB_DOMINEERING_GREETING_04:0 "Why don't you build more confidence? Stop being so insecure. Stop self-pitying yourselves. It's why you're so weak and everyone looks down on you. Beauty means confidence, and confidence means power and authority in this galaxy!"
 SOB_DOMINEERING_GREETING_05:0 "The [From.GetName] needs to stop making excuses for itself. The reason you are weak is because you don't acknowledge the objective truths about beauty. If we were running your country, we'd stop this nonsense before you grow weak. But we'll let you be. It's better that our inferiors are weak."
 SOB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Welcome to the [Root.GetName]! We have the finest plastic surgeons in the galaxy. We also have many talented perfumers, cosmeticians, and more who are more than happy to provide services for your people, if you prove friendly."
 SOB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Mind if we interview some of your citizens? We wish to understand [From.GetSpeciesAdj] physical attributes better. That way, we can figure out ways to improve our plastic surgery technology."
 SOB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Of course we are quite beautiful. It is only through skillful application of beautification technology! We look so natural you can't even tell the difference between a [Root.GetSpeciesName] with a lot of facial reconstruction surgery, and a [Root.GetSpeciesName] with even more facial reconstruction surgery!"
 SOB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "We are the [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural], and we have turned beauty into an artform. We may be willing to divulge our secrets - for a price, that is. The skills we have in regards to the arts of beauty are not to be taken lightly."
 SOB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "Some in the galaxy consider us obsessed with external appearance. They think us superficial and self-absorbed. But it is they who are the self-absorbed - we are the only ones who are confident enough to show ourselves, for we fear not their vile words."
 SOB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_06:0 "Our finest perfumes and cosmetics, you see, utilize a number of plants and minerals native to [Root.GetHomeWorldName]. We are fortunate for that."
 SOB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_07:0 "We are the [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural], and we have turned beauty into an artform. We may be willing to divulge our secrets - for a price, that is. The skills we have in regards to the arts of beauty are not to be taken lightly."
 SOB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_08:0 "Some in the galaxy consider us obsessed with external appearance. They think us superficial and self-absorbed. But it is they who are the self-absorbed - we are the only ones who are confident enough to show ourselves, for we fear not their vile words."
 SOB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_09:0 "Our finest perfumes and cosmetics, you see, utilize a number of plants and minerals native to [Root.GetHomeWorldName]. We are fortunate for that."
 SOB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_10:0 "We would like to visit one of your beauty pageants, in order to get a better idea of your culture, and how your people understand beauty - are you confident types that embrace change, or timid self-pitiers who are insecure and look down on others for embracing their physical attractiveness?"
 SOB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_11:0 "Why do some obsess about 'natural' beauty? Is it wrong to let some recreate their own appearances to be more beautiful?"
 SOB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_12:0 "Beauty is not in the eye of the beholder - it is objective, and our finest scientists and artists have devoted their lives to studying the truth of beauty."
 SOB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_13:0 "We are not obsessed about beauty, not at all. We simply have discovered that success requires mastering the arts of beauty. Anyone who doesn't value physical appearance is a brainless fool."
 SOB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_14:0 "Our culture has discovered long ago that there is an objective beauty. Those who disagree are, sadly, misguided. They are also probably ugly, too, and do not want to accept the truth. The truth, after all, can be painful."
 SOB_NEUTRAL_GREETING_15:0 "It's funny to think that there are those in this galaxy who believe that something like facial or body reconstruction surgery is problematic, even disgusting or immoral. Are there those that do not wish to embrace change? If you are ugly, would it not make sense to remake oneself into the epitome of beauty?"
 SOB_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "You may have the more powerful empire, but you're all an ugly, weak, insecure lot deep down. Don't lie to us. We study these things. We know when people are afraid of change."
 SOB_THREATENED_GREETING_02:0 "Some mistakenly believe you carry authority. Sure, you may have much superficial power, but your native traditions in the arts of beauty are underdeveloped. It will cost you in the long run if you do not know how to find confidence in the aesthetic."
 SOB_THREATENED_GREETING_03:0 "We know deep down the [From.GetName] is a self-pitying rotten mess. Your supposed confidence could easily falter at the slightest offense to your sensibilities. We, on the other hand, embrace beauty, embrace that which is good, and have confidence to face anything in life."
 SOB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "If it isn't our friends from the [From.GetName]! In our lands, you are renowned for your skills in the arts of beauty, skills that almost rival our own. Almost."
 SOB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "You want plastic surgery from our experts? Sure, we might be some of the best experts in beauty as it were, but we have limits to our abilities. For you, we find it difficult that we can make anything more beautiful."
 SOB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "It is good to know others who appreciate the aesthetic things in life like us. We are willing to give every citizen of [From.GetName] a free discount on our beautification services."
 SOB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "What are the ingredients used in the traditional cosmetics and perfumes from [From.GetHomeWorldName]? We find your cosmetics and perfumes to be of wonderful quality and enticing aura. Perhaps we can exchange some information to help each other out!"
 SOB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_05:0 "Perhaps we should organize some beauty pageants between our two peoples as a gesture of trust and friendship. See who has the better facial and body reconstruction surgeons. What do you say?"
 SOB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_06:0 "[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are enlightened. They understand that the propaganda about 'natural' beauty is a lie many tell to alleviate their insecurities. They embrace the idea that it is not wrong to change one's appearance to be more beautiful, that it is not wrong to become more confident."
 SOB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_07:0 "We are glad to have friends like you. You understand our dedication to the arts of beauty, and don't look down on us for it, unlike the other insecure, self-pitying morons in the galaxy."
 SOB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_08:0 "There are xenos out there who don't value physical appearance at all, or at least claim to, pathetic as it may sound. Self-deluded morons lacking in confidence of course, as I'm sure you'll agree. We're glad you are not one of them."
 SOB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_09:0 "Friends, if you refuse to wallow in self-pity, you would have no objection to our embrace of plastic surgery and cosmetics. Why not make the beautiful even more beautiful?"
 SOB_FRIENDLY_GREETING_10:0 "There are those in this galaxy who consider you ugly. That much is true, objectively, but we can remedy that with our beautification experts. You will be beautiful once we modify your faces from their naturally hideous forms! Don't dwell in the vicious cycle of self-pitying like those who refuse our objectively superior sense of aesthetics."
 SOB_UGLY_GREETING_01:0 "You want plastic surgery from our experts? Sure, we might be some of the best experts in beauty as it were, but we have limits to our abilities. And for you, no amount of work can ever make a [From.GetSpeciesName] beautiful."
 SOB_UGLY_GREETING_02:0 "You [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are so ugly, we're not sure if plastic surgery can fix even you lot of monsters. No offense."
 SOB_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Our surgeons know not only how to enhance beauty, but also remove it. Any [From.GetSpeciesName] we capture, we shall not decimate. No, a worse fate awaits them - we shall mutilate their appearance, to the point where even you ugly [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralInsult] would find them repulsive and reprehensible."
 SOB_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "War is so ugly, but there is beauty to be found in it, of course, when beautiful ones such as ourselves are fighting."
 SOB_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Is that an offer of surrender we're hearing? Of course. An insecure society such as yourselves know that you are no match for the truly beautiful, for those who master the arts of beauty also master the arts of war."
 SOB_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "Haha! To think that the likes of you could ever compete with us, to think that you actually believe you have a chance. With our embrace of beauty, we shall triumph in this test of arms. With your self-pitying lack of confidence, how could you ever seek to win? Beauty is objectively superior. Therefore, we are superior to you."
 # Vassal greetings
 SOB_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "Masters! What services shall our experts in beauty provide for you? Perhaps [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] wants some facial and body reconstruction surgery?"
 SOB_VASSAL_GREETING_02:0 "We are here to follow you and learn from you, you who have mastered the arts of beauty."
 SOB_VASSAL_GREETING_03:0 "With your support and protection, we hope to discover more about the amazing truth of beauty in this galaxy."
 SOB_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "Although you are our masters, you possess the same insecure, self-pitying attitudes everyone seems to have. Why are others so jealous of our advances in the arts of beauty?"
 SOB_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_02:0 "We have learned much from the arts of beauty, but we are reluctant to share our findings with masters such as yourselves."
 SOB_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_03:0 "It is laughable to think that self-pitying, insecure mess like the [From.GetName] even vassalized us is in the first place. Mark our words - the galaxy shall be ruled by those who know true beauty, and not otherwise."
 # Declaration of War
 SOB_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! A self-loathing, self-absorbed society such as the [From.GetName] has no right to exist! The galaxy shall be dominated by those who know the true, objective arts of beauty."
 SOB_DOW_PROPOSE_02:0 "This is a declaration of war! We know you are jealous of our pleasing aesthetics. Now is your chance to act on that jealousy! But know that we are stronger, and more confident, than you will ever be."
 #Robot/Mechanical Empire stuff
 SOB_MECH_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Whoever created you in the first place had no concept of beauty. Pity, we could have taught them a lot."
 SOB_MECH_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "Let us guess, your creators were insecure about their appearance. That is why they made you so lacking in physical appeal, so they could feel better about themselves."
 SOB_MECH_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "You might want to know that our experts in beauty do know how to work with not only organics, but robots as well. But do we really want to make your kind more aesthetically pleasing? No. We take a sadistic pleasure in seeing you bag of bolts and nuts run around like the junk you are."
 SOB_MECH_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "We are the galaxy's foremost experts in matters of beauty. However, we are not only skilled with beautifying organics - our knowledge of beauty also applies to mechanics as well! If you prove yourselves friendly robots, we will happily cooperate."
 SOB_MECH_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "So... if you are truly sentient, that means like the other organics, you might be able to feel insecure around us and start self-pitying yourselves? We hope not. Confidence is good whether you are an organic or robot."
 SOB_MECH_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "We would like to know more about how mechanical beings like yourselves understand beauty. How do you distinguish yourselves in terms of physical attractiveness? Can you even understand such a concept? Our scientists and artists would love to hear your perspective."
 SOB_MECH_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Even mechanical beings such as yourselves could use a beauty upgrade. Our surgeons are not only capable of operating on organic beings, but mechanical ones as well! For such wonderful robots such as yourselves, we are more than happy to provide services for a steeply discounted price."
 SOB_MECH_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "Would you like us to assist in adding beautification protocols into your programming? If there are any robots out there that would make good experts in beauty, it would be the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]."
 SOB_MECH_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "It seems your creators were capable. Perhaps they even understood objective beauty like we do, for you have a kind of superior confidence that even many of the best organics lack."
 SOB_MECH_S_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Your creators are pitiful to let mongrel robots handle their affairs. This is what species are reduced to when their society is built on the sad foundations of self-absorbed insecurity."
 SOB_MECH_S_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Successful species would understand the truths of beauty, and gain the confidence to master their own destinies instead of relying on machines. That is no offense to you [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] - it is your masters who are clearly pathetic."
 SOB_MECH_S_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Friends! We think it might be a splendid idea if we met your creators whom you coddle. We can teach them a thing or two about beauty. Perhaps they will gain the confidence they need to escape their self-perpetuating cycle of self-pity and become their own masters again!"

 ES_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Let us show the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] the true way of things - that in this universe, some were born to rule, and others to grovel at their feet, and we are without doubt the former."
 # Vassal greetings
 ES_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "Ah! Our superiors from the [From.GetName]. How shall we oppress both [From.GetSpeciesAdj] and [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] working class scum today?"
 ES_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "It is tragic that we must take orders from the likes of the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Mark our words - we do not forget our humiliations, and when we become powerful once more, you shall be taught your place!"
 # Declaration of War
 ES_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! In the natural order of things, there are those that must perish to make way for their superiors. There is no more time for diplomacy. Instead, let us see who is the better!"
 # Xenial Merrymakers
 XM_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "Those who are eager to bring death and destruction to countless billions across the galaxy - know that we do the opposite, for it is our goal to encourage life and mirth, to drink and be merry!"
 XM_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural], can't you see the tragedy you will wring upon yourselves? The sadness and melancholy of your existences? Why not bring joy instead to the universe?"
 XM_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "The [From.GetName] is so pitiful. It doesn't matter whether you are stronger or weaker than us - You would rather spread your sad, pathetic ways across the galaxy than work fruitfully to cultivate happiness and joy? We want to help lift your spirits, but you won't let us."
 XM_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "Do the people of the [From.GetName] know how to laugh and enjoy themselves? Let us teach you how to party and enjoy life! Why such hesitation?"
 XM_HOSTILE_GREETING_05:0 "We have heard horrible stories from the [From.GetName] - stories about how its population are eternally depressed, never able to know the true joy of a good celebration or cheer."
 XM_HOSTILE_GREETING_06:0 "We are not interested in any merrymaking with you. We are... currently busy with other matters."
 XM_HOSTILE_GREETING_07:0 "We would never say such a thing directly, but more disrespectful fellows have told us that slosh you call alcohol is more like excrement from a [From.GetSpeciesOrganName] exiting through a diseased [From.GetSpeciesMouthName]. Shall we give those who disrespect you a good talking to!"
 XM_HOSTILE_GREETING_08:0 "Aha! No. Wait. You again! And here our delegation is drunk... so drunk... so, so drunk. Maybe... drink alcohol with us too... maybe it will make you more likeable...."
 XM_HOSTILE_GREETING_09:0 "You are always welcome at our many celebrations. However, we humbly request you leave out any negative attitudes - it could ruin the festive spirit of our revelers."
 XM_HOSTILE_GREETING_10:0 "Although the [From.GetSpeciesName] are renowned for their charisma, we are afraid that you only use it to mask the insecurities and uncertainties that plague your society, as we don't feel any sense of genuine joy in your festivities and celebrations."
 XM_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "The root of your weakness is not a lack of strength, or capability, or knowledge on your part. It is a lack of happiness, of purpose. Our hearts break to see your people's morale so low. Come visit us and party your worries away!"
 XM_DOMINEERING_GREETING_02:0 "If you focused more on celebrating your people's achievements and abilities, the [From.GetName] would be much more powerful and respected. Our kind suggestion - focus instead on cultivating joy and happiness in your nation."
 XM_DOMINEERING_GREETING_03:0 "We've heard that the [From.GetSpeciesAdj] liquor industry is in poor shape. Not much a surprise, as reports suggest the [From.GetName] does not devote enough resources to the happiness and merriment of its people."
 XM_DOMINEERING_GREETING_04:0 "Your festivities are lacking in grandioseness and thrill, due to the impoverished state of your nation, but we are sure that if you are genuine in your attempts to be happy, no amount of material lacking can deter your willingness to enjoy life."
 XM_DOMINEERING_GREETING_05:0 "We are considering sending a large shipment of booze to the [From.GetName] as charity. Your people need it, more than you think."
 XM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "The [Root.GetName] is founded on the principles of happiness and joy for all beings - whether our own citizens or yours."
 XM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "We are a people who take the spirit of celebration seriously. Do you?"
 XM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Laughter can cure even the most terrible of ailments."
 XM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "If one always tries to be happy and content with life, then even something like death and pain can't hurt you. Laugh, and be merry! Our genuine wishes is that your people are happy and can celebrate the joys of life."
 XM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "These are our warm wishes to you, no matter whether you come to us with friendship in mind or have malicious ulterior motives - that the people of the [From.GetName] will always experience happiness and contentment."
 XM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_06:0 "We see potential in you, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Why don't you visit us and see how we party? Let us learn from each other. I'm sure you have much to teach us about dancing, drinking, and loving life."
 XM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_07:0 "Representatives of the [From.GetName] are always welcome in [Root.GetHomeWorldName]. We are very open to outsiders. Would you care to join us, to learn more about our way of life?"
 XM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_08:0 "Why force people to endure the unendurable? Let them experience festivals, celebrations, holidays - let them rest from their weary existence, and appreciate the finer things in life! That is our philosophy."
 XM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_09:0 "[Root.GetSpeciesAdj] booze is the best in the galaxy, guaranteed. Or at least some of the best. Am I... am I... oh dear, I am drunk! I am so very drunk! And you... who are you?"
 XM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_10:0 "A question, if you don't mind - can we arrange a trip to visit some of your cities to see how the alcohol industry of the [From.GetName]? We are always curious how other xenos get smashed."
 XM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_11:0 "A word of kind advice - remember that the happiness of your people is of utmost importance. It is through joy and celebration that they can come to better understand themselves and their place in the cosmos."
 XM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_12:0 "We prefer to enjoy ourselves, and engage in celebration whenever we can. Holidays are a time meant to reflect on what good there is in the universe. Our purpose as dictated by whomever or whatever created us, was to enjoy the spirit of comradery and mirth."
 XM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_13:0 "It is scientifically proven that regular relaxation, celebration, and festivities can dramatically increase the productivity of any sentient being, [Root.GetSpeciesName] or [From.GetSpeciesName]."
 XM_NEUTRAL_GREETING_14:0 "Did you know? Our holidays and ritual observances have been statistically calculated to bring the most euphoria among our citizens."
 XM_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "There is obviously much that the [From.GetName] does well. The question is of course whether your citizens are happy. If they aren't, any success you have now will be but fleeting. After all, if no one is happy, what point is there in all you have gained?"
 XM_THREATENED_GREETING_02:0 "We have heard that [From.GetSpeciesAdj] hosts the some of best parties and the best festivals in the galaxy. One has to wonder what is the secret to your success...."
 XM_THREATENED_GREETING_03:0 "The quality of [From.GetSpeciesAdj] liquor must be very high! We are sure it is the main reason for your great power and prestige across this galaxy."
 XM_THREATENED_GREETING_04:0 "We see that the [From.GetName] prioritizes the well-being of its citizens. At the least, we hope it does, because how else can your success and influence be explained?"
 XM_THREATENED_GREETING_05:0 "We are considering sending a large shipment of booze to the [From.GetName] as a gift. Your people are prosperous and influential across the galaxy - they deserve it."
 XM_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "Celebrate! Celebrate! Celebrate until the end of the universe!"
 XM_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "There is nothing better than drinking a [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] drink! Come, join us - let us celebrate the joys of the universe together. Laugh and be merry!"
 XM_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Be happy and be merry, friends! May the [From.GetName] be ever happy and ever merry."
 XM_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] are a welcome sight at any festivity. No matter what, you bring joy to us and to the universe."
 XM_FRIENDLY_GREETING_05:0 "We can learn so much from each other. Let us pool our efforts together to spread laughter and good cheer to all in the universe."
 XM_FRIENDLY_GREETING_06:0 "Ho ho ho! Merriness to you all, friends!"
 XM_FRIENDLY_GREETING_07:0 "Would you like to try some of the finest and strongest [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] spirits? Guaranteed to knock you out! Let's drink ourselves silly and continue with the negotiations afterwards. Tomorrow, even!"
 XM_FRIENDLY_GREETING_08:0 "I am intoxicated. I am very intoxicated! You should be intoxicated too! Friends, be intoxicated! Intoxicate yourselves with our great selection of alcohols! Woohoo!"
 XM_FRIENDLY_GREETING_09:0 "A toast to life! To your health, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]!"
 XM_FRIENDLY_GREETING_10:0 "The night is forever young on [Root.GetHomeWorldName], and its denizens forever dancing on and on in a gala of excitement and joyous celebration."
 XM_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "Our forces have high morale, happy as can be. That is our best weapon against you!"
 XM_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "It doesn't matter how strong or weak we are, for we are happy and content with ourselves. We will survive this war, and have a big party afterwards to celebrate!"
 XM_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Even if we lose, you will never destroy our people's desire to be happy and revel in life."
 XM_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "I've heard rumors the average citizen of the [From.GetName] stereotypes the [Root.GetName] as a lot of ineffectual, alcohol-addled party-lovers obsessed with pleasure and fun. We aim to prove that we have other talents as well, such as war."
 XM_WAR_GREETING_05:0 "We celebrate all aspects of our society, military included. Our soldiers are the finest and the happiest, and festivities in their honor are a common sight on [Root.GetHomeWorldName]. Can you say the same for your troops?"
 XM_WAR_GREETING_06:0 "Who... who are you? I am drunk, I am very drunk! Attack! Attack! Defend! Wait.... What?"
 # Vassal greetings
 XM_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "Masters! Shall we host a celebration for your visit? Perhaps you want to sample some of the best booze in the galaxy? Perhaps a hard liquor to knock you out silly, or a refined drink to relax the senses. Whatever you want, we shall provide."
 XM_VASSAL_GREETING_02:0 "Celebrate! Be joyful that you are great and prosperous, just as we are joyful you are there to protect us."
 XM_VASSAL_GREETING_03:0 "Sorry, but I am completely wasted right now! This isn't rudeness! This is how [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] greet each other! This is completely normal! An honor! Come drink with us!"
 XM_VASSAL_GREETING_04:0 "We are always so happy to see you. Let us work together, student and pupil, to spread the word of good cheer around the galaxy!"
 XM_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "You must be careful masters. Your servants' morale is low, their happiness declining and declining. Happiness is the key to success in all matters."
 XM_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_02:0 "There is a problem when we are working to spread happiness across the galaxy, while the [From.GetName], whom we nominally hold allegiance to, try to do the opposite."
 XM_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_03:0 "The quality of your intoxicating drinks has suffered as of late. Perhaps it is a sign of problems in the [From.GetName]. Perhaps not."
 XM_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_04:0 "The celebrations and festivities hosted by the [From.GetName] are quite unentertaining and uninspired. This, despite our efforts to help you."
 # Declaration of War
 XM_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! Though we abhor bloodshed, the [From.GetName] has gone too far. For too long you have threatened our people's happiness."
 XM_DOW_PROPOSE_02:0 "This is a declaration of war! You have severely underestimated us, thinking we are a bunch of moronic revelers and partiers. Think again! We can fight, and fight we shall if it is to ensure our people can survive to live another day."
 XM_DOW_PROPOSE_03:0 "This is a declaration of war! I am completely intoxicated, but this war is not a mistake! Prepare ourselves! Yourself! Yourselves.... Ourselves?"
 # Valiant Hearts
 VH_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "You try our patience. But patience we have. We have solemnly vowed that we shall never raise arms unjustly or unnecessarily, even against those we hate."
 VH_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "If we must come to blows with the [From.GetName] we will do our utmost best to reduce casualties on both sides. We will not be weaklings to be massacred. But let us hope that never comes to pass."
 VH_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "Do not think our military exists to taunt you. It exists to protect ourselves, from greedy, power-hungry aggressors. If the [From.GetName] acts as such, we will have no choice but to defend ourselves."
 VH_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "Wars begin and end the same way. Heroism and gallantry, noble virtues will be destroyed by such base conditions as hunger and exhaustion. Do not let our disagreements spiral out of control, [From.GetSpeciesName], and cause unnecessary suffering! "
 VH_HOSTILE_GREETING_05:0 "We are aware that we do not see things eye to eye with each other. However, on our honor, we will do our part to maintain peace if you do as well."
 VH_HOSTILE_GREETING_06:0 "While we may detest you, we never wish to bring upon you the horrors of war, but we will fight you if it is necessary. Let us hope, however, that level-headedness will prevail, and peace reign supreme between our two nations."
 VH_HOSTILE_GREETING_07:0 "If the ghosts of the stars could speak, they would warn us - warn us of ourselves. Do not let our mutual hatred grow into the destruction of war!"
 VH_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "Let your weakness be a strength, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Though you may be minor in power, your invisibility is protection. Hope that the greater nations never notice you, so that you may never be involved in a terrible conflict."
 VH_DOMINEERING_GREETING_02:0 "Perhaps your pitiful standing among the nations of this galaxy is a curse, but you have nothing to fear from us. We hate anything more than those who prey upon the weak, and we will never cause you suffering."
 VH_DOMINEERING_GREETING_03:0 "Your military is not up to par. Be careful, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Nations greater than you who ignored their defenses have fallen to the yoke of tyranny and greed and great suffering."
 VH_DOMINEERING_GREETING_04:0 "Your lack of strength should be of concern to your leaders. We advise building up a stronger military not to attack and conquer others, but to defend your own peace and prosperity."
 VH_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "War is a joke the old play on the young. And we refuse to be part of that joke. We will defend ourselves as necessary - we are ever vigilant, yes - but we will never initiate hostilities."
 VH_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "Anyone who has seen the dead of war - young soldiers, their blood and limbs and insides strung across the heavens like debris and garbage - will think hard before starting a war."
 VH_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "You may laugh at the irony that we abhor war yet have amassed such a great military. Know this: we are not naive. On the contrary, we know precisely the suffering and devastation it brings."
 VH_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "There is no bliss in war, only death. We find no joy in developing our military armaments and training our soldiers. And yet, it is the only thing we can do if we are to ensure peace."
 VH_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "Our warriors are strong in combat, and knowledgeable in tactics. Yet strong is also their resolve to prevent unnecessary bloodshed, and great their wisdom in knowing war is the greatest evil."
 VH_NEUTRAL_GREETING_06:0 "Behind every gun is a [Root.GetSpeciesName]. We are the jaded, the naive. We are the honorable, the criminal. We are the bound for legend, and the lost to history. We are the knights of the stars, the ghosts in the void."
 VH_NEUTRAL_GREETING_07:0 "It is our solemn vow - made when the [Root.GetName] was established - that though our arms shall never waver, never also shall they ever be raised in the name of unnecessary bloodshed."
 VH_NEUTRAL_GREETING_08:0 "Do not fear our weapons and our armies. We do not wish to use them against you. And we hope we shall never need to use them against you."
 VH_NEUTRAL_GREETING_09:0 "You must not ever worry. The [Root.GetName] shall never initiate war against your people. The only question is, will you attack us?"
 VH_NEUTRAL_GREETING_10:0 "Be kind to the weak and those who cannot defend themselves. They suffer from the terror of war the most."
 VH_NEUTRAL_GREETING_11:0 "We admire your ideals and commitment to peace. But there are those out there who do not see you the same way. Build up your military, that you can protect your beautiful love of peace, that it is not tarnished by the greed of others."
 VH_NEUTRAL_GREETING_12:0 "Your innocence is something we respect and cherish. It was once the innocence we had, before we learned with sadness that the only way to prevent war is to build a terrifying, great military so others dare not attack us."
 VH_NEUTRAL_GREETING_13:0 "You who love peace and refuse to come to blows with others - let it be known that though we have great and mighty armadas and soldiers, we will not disturb you. We only mean to protect ourselves, not cause unneeded suffering."
 VH_NEUTRAL_GREETING_14:0 "The political philosophies of the [Root.GetName] and [From.GetName] are not as different as you think. We both hold peace above all else - no war is worth the effort nor the suffering. Yet the difference is that we decided to develop a terrifying military to ensure that we will never need to fight others."
 VH_NEUTRAL_GREETING_15:0 "Peace, and a love of peace, is a wonderful thing. We [Root.GetNameSpeciesPlural] do not disagree with you on that. But be wary - there are those who seek to destroy peace, and cause unending, infinite suffering to others. Best to have a strong military to prevent that from happening."
 VH_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "Know that though we are not many in number, compared to the might wielded by the [From.GetName], but our valor and our valiant hearts are a powerful weapon."
 VH_THREATENED_GREETING_02:0 "Our valiant hearts have shown, time and time again, [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] to be true defenders of noble values. It is a threat even great empires such as the [From.GetName] will fear if they are foolish enough to attack us."
 VH_THREATENED_GREETING_03:0 "Beware, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]! Your strength can be a weakness. Do not seduce yourself with false promises of glory in wars of conquest and adventure, for there is no glory in such."
 VH_THREATENED_GREETING_04:0 "We are in a precarious situation. Weak, compared to the likes of the [From.GetName]. That is not a good thing, we know, for our people's survival and happiness depends on our strength."
 VH_THREATENED_GREETING_05:0 "We only hope your intentions are peaceful. Ours certainly is, despite our devotion to building a great military like yours."
 VH_THREATENED_GREETING_06:0 "The [From.GetName] are much more powerful than the [Root.GetName]. We hope this will not be a problem in the future. We are willing to make sacrifices to protect our own lands, remember that, but we hate nothing more than the horror of war wrought upon innocents."
 VH_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "We are at peace. There is nothing better, friend. War is a terrible thing, and it should never be used in the name of greed, jealousy, and bloodlust."
 VH_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "May our armies intimidate our enemies, so that they may never attack us, and may harmony and blissful peace reign in the stars until the end of time and space."
 VH_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "Let us work together to strengthen our mutual defenses, so those who would seek to bring chaos and suffering to us will meet quite the challenge."
 VH_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "War is a terrible thing, friend. Your strength should only be used to deter those who are greedy and bloodthirsty, it must never be used for the sake of your own greed and bloodthirst."
 VH_FRIENDLY_GREETING_05:0 "War is an inherently unjust and counterproductive way to settle differences. Yet the reality of this galaxy is that we must prepare for war. We hope you agree with these sentiments."
 VH_FRIENDLY_GREETING_06:0 "We were innocent, once, you know, oblivious to the horrors of war. And then it came. The clashing of steel and the milion fires of death, and we were forever changed. "
 VH_FRIENDLY_GREETING_07:0 "[From.GetSpeciesNamePlural], you who are noble and wise, let us work together so whatever remaining innocents in this galaxy do not share that fate!"
 VH_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "We cannot learn how to live together in peace if [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] [Root.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural] and [From.GetSpeciesAdj] [From.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural] kill each other in the senseless tragedy of war. And yet it was you who started this all."
 VH_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "It is never honorable and never fitting to die for your country in a war - especially one fueled by aggression and greed. Yet here we are, forced to defend ourselves against you. We aim to end this war as quickly as we can, to minimize all suffering."
 VH_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "Only the dead have seen the end of this war."
 VH_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "We do not fear you. You are but [From.GetSpeciesAdj] [From.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural] who do not know that war is of splintered steel and shrieking fire. When we built our spaceships, we built with not only metal alone but legs, arms, skulls, helmets, all the debris of this mighty struggle. This is reality of what you face."
 VH_WAR_GREETING_05:0 "No matter what happens we don't believe that this is the end, not here amongst these stars, not today. We have no fear left in us."
 VH_WAR_GREETING_06:0 "In war, too many perish, too many injured, broken forever. We who are alive must tell the stories of our sacrifices, our struggles, so that such horrors never happen again. But until that day, we fight on."
 VH_WAR_GREETING_07:0 "We hate your kind the most. It is because of warmongers like the [From.GetName] that we must engage in the unnecessary activities of warfare."
 VH_WAR_GREETING_08:0 "Whether you believe yourself to be noble warriors, or bringers of peace, or worshippers of prosperity, you are in actuality detestable - the sort that brings war and death upon others while speaking lofty, dignified language."
 VH_WAR_GREETING_09:0 "We know why you come. You come for our riches. This is the greed that turns [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] and [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] into monsters. And monsters know only war."
 VH_WAR_GREETING_10:0 "Do not be blinded by your bloodlust! If it consumes us, can we really call yourselves sentient [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] and [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]?"
 VH_WAR_GREETING_11:0 "We may be enemies at war with each other, but we can still work to reduce the amount of casualties and suffering on both sides."
 VH_WAR_GREETING_12:0 "We understand that in wartime it is not easy to make compromises with the enemy. But at the least let us ensure that finish this conflict as cleanly and quickly as possible. The less suffering that happens, the better."
 VH_WAR_GREETING_13:0 "The [Root.GetName] abhors conflict and the suffering it brings. We promise to not cause any undue suffering to your kind while this war continues, and hope you feel the same."
 # Vassal greetings
 VH_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "Masters! Work to use your might to bring peace and prosperity to all corners of the galaxy! That is our only wish."
 VH_VASSAL_GREETING_02:0 "Let the strength of your space fleets deter our enemies from attacking us. There is nothing worse than war, but if we fail to prepare for it, how can we hope to protect ourselves from its horrors?"
 VH_VASSAL_GREETING_03:0 "Great and unending are your armies and fleets, [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. We only hope that great and unending is also your dedication to the principles of peace!"
 VH_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "Our capitulation to you was a necessity, but an evil necessity, to ensure that peace reigns among the stars. "
 VH_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_02:0 "Some may consider us cowards for bowing before such an unlikeable nation as the [From.GetName]. We consider it an act of bravery, to resist the urge to cause unnecessary bloodshed and the deaths of innocent [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] and [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural], and instead endure the unendurable under your tyranny."
 VH_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_03:0 "How can [From.GetRulerTitle] [From.GetRulerName] sleep well at night knowing the suffering the [From.GetName] brings to countless sentient peoples? How long must we suffer under your yoke?"
 # Declaration of War
 VH_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! Alas, what tragedy that we must come to arms. It is a rare occasion when we initiate hostilities - our militaries were meant only to defend. But we are left with little choice. Warmongers like you are a threat."
 VH_DOW_PROPOSE_02:0 "This is a declaration of war! We don't want to do this. We can't. We simply can't. And yet we must. The [From.GetName] has gone too far."
 VH_DOW_PROPOSE_03:0 "This is a declaration of war! It is our sacred, honorable tradition that we never declare wars. We break that noble vow today, for your crimes are too many to be ignored. We must stop you now, lest you cause more suffering to this galaxy."
 # Zestful Orators
 ZO_HOSTILE_GREETING_01:0 "When training young [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] [Root.GetSpeciesSpawnNamePlural] in the finer points of debate, we often ask them to take the point of view of the [From.GetName]. It is a difficult task, however, given how unlikeable and distasteful the [Root.GetSpeciesAdj] spirit can be."
 ZO_HOSTILE_GREETING_02:0 "The zeitgeist of our times is to refute the notion that [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural] have any ideas worth sharing with the rest of the cosmos."
 ZO_HOSTILE_GREETING_03:0 "In your declamations and speeches you make use of words to veil your agenda, but we can see through your elementary rhetorical tricks."
 ZO_HOSTILE_GREETING_04:0 "Can you even comprehend our words? Perhaps your minds are so underdeveloped you are incapable of appreciating the finer nuances of dialogue and debate."
 ZO_HOSTILE_GREETING_05:0 "When others ask how we [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] speak so eloquently, persuasively, and alluringly, our answer is simple: avoid talking in the garbled, crude manner of the [From.GetSpeciesNamePlural]!"
 ZO_DOMINEERING_GREETING_01:0 "There are many who regret speaking out, but few who regret remaining silent. Be careful what you say next - it could be the last thing you ever say."
 ZO_DOMINEERING_GREETING_02:0 "Envoys from the pitiful [From.GetName]? Your words will not persuade even the most gullible of us, given how weak you are, but you can try."
 ZO_DOMINEERING_GREETING_03:0 "Your attempts at negotiation are always lacking in skill and rhetoric. We almost feel the need to do something for you out of pity, but shall refrain."
 ZO_NEUTRAL_GREETING_01:0 "Ah, the representatives from the [From.GetName] return! What shall we argue about today? We are interested in learning your viewpoints."
 ZO_NEUTRAL_GREETING_02:0 "The [Root.GetName] holds those who are articulate and quick-witted in speech in the highest regard."
 ZO_NEUTRAL_GREETING_03:0 "Shall our finest orators debate each other on various topics?"
 ZO_NEUTRAL_GREETING_04:0 "It does not matter how mighty or cunning one is - if one cannot convince others to agree, then what good are any of those other skills?"
 ZO_NEUTRAL_GREETING_05:0 "All sentients communicate with each other, one way or another. The question is, however, how effectively one can communicate."
 ZO_NEUTRAL_GREETING_06:0 "Have you come to observe some of our famous orators debate at length on various topics? It is quite a spectacle to witness."
 ZO_NEUTRAL_GREETING_07:0 "What separates us from animals? It is not because we are rational - it is because we are irrational, and able to persuade ourselves to do things detrimental to our interests."
 ZO_THREATENED_GREETING_01:0 "They who have mastered oratory enjoy and wield a power more durable than that of a great galactic empire. We admit that you are one such nation."
 ZO_THREATENED_GREETING_02:0 "Endless are the ways sentient species can debate and argue, but we must concede that you have mastered a good number of these methods compared to us."
 ZO_THREATENED_GREETING_03:0 "Your words, we must confess, are very articulate and persuasive. But then again, we are not in a position to counter them recklessly."
 ZO_FRIENDLY_GREETING_01:0 "The rhetorical techniques used in [From.GetSpeciesAdj] oration always amaze us. Shall we discuss the finer points of our cultures' respective schools of debate?"
 ZO_FRIENDLY_GREETING_02:0 "We know the diplomats of the [From.GetName] always choose their words carefully and judiciously, and we appreciate that."
 ZO_FRIENDLY_GREETING_03:0 "We must admit, we never thought we would find anyone as dedicated to the art of debating as you. We respect your cunning, honeyed words."
 ZO_FRIENDLY_GREETING_04:0 "The [From.GetSpeciesAdj] [From.GetSpeciesNamePluralCompliment] return! Come, dear friends, let us engage in a friendly debate on various topics before we start negotiations."
 ZO_FRIENDLY_GREETING_05:0 "We truly enjoy discussions with your people. Even the most ignorant of your people make thought-provoking speeches."
 ZO_FRIENDLY_GREETING_06:0 "As one of our famous orators once said, 'If one is not ashamed to think it, one should not be ashamed to say it.' Speak freely, friend! Even if we disagree, we can find common ground."
 ZO_WAR_GREETING_01:0 "To be unable to speak - that would be horrid! We fight on, so that our words may never be silenced by the likes of you!"
 ZO_WAR_GREETING_02:0 "As much as we enjoy a peaceful debate, that does not mean we have no skill in war, either. After all, debates and arguments are just another form of battle."
 ZO_WAR_GREETING_03:0 "We once sparred with clever words and rhetorical tricks. Now we fight with spaceships and explosions. A somewhat different approach to our disagreements, no?"
 ZO_WAR_GREETING_04:0 "After this war, if you survive, perhaps we can engage in a friendly debate. But for now, the [From.GetName] is, alas, a threat to our way of life."
 ZO_WAR_GREETING_05:0 "Come! Say your worst, [From.GetSpeciesAdj] ruffians and knaves! Your words do little to sway your eternal, noble spirit!"
 # Vassal greetings
 ZO_VASSAL_GREETING_01:0 "Rhetoric is the art of ruling the minds of sentients. In that regard, the [From.GetName] is indeed a master of rhetoric. How may we serve you today?"
 ZO_VASSAL_GREETING_02:0 "Certainly, the [From.GetName] counts among those who know how to speak, for those who know how to speak control the universe."
 ZO_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_01:0 "Do you make a mockery of us, speaking to us in such patronizing terms? Go ahead. You can continue your condescensions for now."
 ZO_VASSAL_GREETING_DISLOYAL_02:0 "The representatives of the [From.GetName] are often arrogant, which reduces the effectiveness of your rhetoric that tries to instill fear in us."
 # Declaration of War
 ZO_DOW_PROPOSE_01:0 "This is a declaration of war! For too long have you tried to persuade us with your honeyed but false words. The time for courage is now. The time for glory is now. The time for action is now. You will be defeated on the field of battle!"
 ZO_DOW_PROPOSE_02:0 "This is a declaration of war! This is a declaration of war! Words have failed between the [Root.GetName] and [From.GetName]. No longer shall we exchange heated arguments in an attempt to reconcile our differences - now we go to war."
