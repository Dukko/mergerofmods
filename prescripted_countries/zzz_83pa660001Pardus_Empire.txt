The first emperors brought the unruly pride of warriors together for a single purpose - the glory of all Pardus kind. The early empire spread quickly, and peace, through discipline and faith, spread across all Panthera - peace for those wise enough to accept the benovolent rule of the empire. Now a united Panthera has discovered space travel, and with it, a host of new worlds to benefit from the enlightened rule of the Pardus - those worlds wise enough to accept it, anyway."
