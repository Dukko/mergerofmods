While large, slow, and clumsy, Syklids are particularly observant and forward-thinking. Once they pupate into Abastids, however, much of their intellectual capacity is lost in exchange for greatly improved mobility and strength. Their society is organized around the drive to acquire authentic experiences. Amassing material wealth is only a means to this end. Syklids strive to squeeze every drop of out of their early years, stockpiling pleasurable memories that may sustain them in their later lives of mindless labor and service."
