The eternal spires, rising and floating into the sky stand testament to their great craft. Founded, after the exile of the Highborne, the Kingdom of Quel'thalas bathed the lands in eternal spring, due to the powers of the mystical sunwell, which gave them unsurpassable capabilities. Lead by the beloved King Dath'remar Sunstrider, the shining jewel of Quel'thalas became a beacon in the darkness of barbarism for millennia. "
