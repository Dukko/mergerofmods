Although the Premier speaks on their behalf in galactic affairs, no single central authority sets internal economic objectives or manages scientific endeavor on their homeworld Camrena. The dozen or so nations that constitute the Confederation nevertheless all employ the same kind of tightly controlled autocratic systems."
