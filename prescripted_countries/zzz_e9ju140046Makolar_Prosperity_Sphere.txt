Their once brutally dry dune seas were blooming with green for weeks at a time. Ice was descending upon the peaks of the highest mountains. If nothing was done, their scientists said, forests would take over the salt flats and rivers would run through every wadi. In short order, the adapted their society to a more sustainable economic model, moving heavy industry off-world to other locations in the Makol system and creating the Prosperity Sphere to manage future development."
