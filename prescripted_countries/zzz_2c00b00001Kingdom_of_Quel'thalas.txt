But many years ago, the undead scourge invaded Quel'thalas and drove the elves to the brink of extinction. Lead by the evil deathknight Arthas, the scourge destroyed the mystical sunwell and therby severing the elves from their source of their arcane power. Though the scars of that conflict are evident, the remaining elves have banded together and retaken much of their homeland. Calling themselves Sin'dorei, (children of the blood), these elves are dedicated to regain the vast powers they once commanded. With the restoration of the Sunwell, the elves pushed forward to a new shining era of prosperty. However, they will never forget that sacrifces must be made if they are to protect their eternal homelands and their means by which they sustain their society. "
